She initially rose to fame after being selected as the February 1990 Playmate of the Month for Playboy magazine.[4] Anderson went on to frequent appearances on the magazine's cover, holding the record of the most Playboy covers by any person.[5]
She became known to a wider audience in 1991, appearing as a recurring character, Lisa, on the award-winning ABC comedy series Home Improvement for its first two seasons. She received international recognition for her starring role as C. J. Parker in the action-drama television series Baywatch, further cementing her status as a sex symbol.[6][7]
Anderson has appeared in films such as Raw Justice (1994), Barb Wire (1996), and Blonde and Blonder (2008). She was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2006.[8]
Anderson is a prominent activist for the animal rights movement and has conducted campaigns condemning the commercial fur industry and promoting veganism through the animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).[9]
Anderson was born in Ladysmith, British Columbia, the daughter of Barry, a furnace repairman, and Carol Anderson, a waitress.[10] Her great-grandfather, Juho Hyytiäinen, was Finnish and partly of Romani descent, a native of Saarijärvi, and left the Grand Duchy of Finland (which was a part of the Russian Empire at the time) for Canada in 1908.[11] He changed his name to Anderson when he arrived as an immigrant. Anderson also has Russian ancestry on her mother's side.[12]
Anderson got some press coverage right after her birth as a "Centennial Baby", having been born on July 1, 1967, the 100th anniversary of Canada's official founding via the Constitution Act, 1867.[8][13]
Anderson claims she suffered sexual abuse as a child, a fact she revealed publicly in 2014. She said she was molested by a female babysitter from ages 6 to 10, raped by a 25-year-old man when she was age 12, and gang-raped by her boyfriend and six of his friends when she was 14.[14]
Anderson attended Highland Secondary School in Comox, British Columbia. During high school, she played on the volleyball team.[15] She graduated in 1985.[16] In 1988, Anderson moved to Vancouver and worked as a fitness instructor.[16]

On June 28, 2006, Anderson posed naked with other protesters on a window display of the Stella McCartney boutique in London, England. It was a PETA gala event before the PETA Humanitarian Awards. Anderson went inside the boutique and said she would take her clothes off if the event raised enough money for PETA, which it did. She campaigned against Kentucky Fried Chicken. In 2001, Anderson released a letter in support of PETA's campaign against Kentucky Fried Chicken, stating "What KFC does to 750 million chickens each year is not civilized or acceptable." She later made a video about KFC's treatment of chickens.[50] In January 2006, Anderson requested that the Governor of Kentucky remove a bust of Colonel Sanders, the founder of KFC, from display but her request was refused even when she offered her own bust in exchange.

She has also campaigned against seal hunting in Canada. In March 2006, Anderson asked to speak to Prime Minister Stephen Harper about the annual seal hunt but was refused. In May 2006, she petitioned individuals on the street for their opinion on the Canadian Seal Hunt. In December 2009, Anderson, photographed in a T-shirt with a drawn picture of a seal pup on it, was featured in a new ad campaign for PETA.

She joined forces with the organization again in a campaign for the boycott of fruit-juice maker POM. The "Pom Horrible Campaign"[51] has resulted in the company halting animal tests.
Anderson became the center of controversy when she posed in a bikini nearly nude for a PETA ad that was banned in Montreal, Quebec, on grounds that the ad was sexist. Anderson retorted saying, "In a city that is known for its exotic dancing and for being progressive and edgy, how sad that a woman would be banned from using her own body in a political protest over the suffering of cows and chickens. In some parts of the world, women are forced to cover their whole bodies with burqas – is that next? I didn't think that Canada would be so puritanical."[52]
She became a company spokesperson for FrogAds, Inc. in March 2012.[53] In February 2014, she stripped for a Valentine's Day-themed ad for PETA, urging dog lovers to cuddle up with their pets during winter.[54]

In December 2016, in a statement to People magazine, Anderson called WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange a "hero". She stated that he had done everyone "a great service. Everyone in the world has benefited because of WikiLeaks". Meanwhile, "elaborate plots against him and made up sexual allegations could result in him being extradited to the US — where he would not be treated fairly — because of his exposure of truths."[65] In April 2019, over several tweets, Anderson was angry at Assange's ejection from London's Ecuadorian embassy.[66] In May 2019, Anderson visited Assange in HMP Belmarsh with Kristinn Hrafnsson and said she believed Assange to be innocent and "a good man... an incredible person. I love him, I can't imagine what he has been going through."[67][67]
In October 2019, Anderson announced she will be travelling to Australia in November 2019 to challenge Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to stand up for Julian Assange. In her announcement she referenced the 'disparaging remarks' he made about her in 2018 and challenged him to debate the matter 'in front of the Australian people'. She also wrote another letter to Scott Morrison asking him to use his influence to secure Assange's release. Morrison replied by letter saying that his government would respect Britain's judicial process and Assange would not receive any special help. In the text of a speech she had intended to give at Parliament House, Canberra, Anderson claimed that Mr Assange was suffering "psychological torture" in jail and that "every moment he is in there, he is in danger". [68] During her visit to Australia she also filmed a television commercial for Australian brand Ultra Tune. [69] [70]

Anderson married Tommy Lee, drummer of Mötley Crüe, on February 19, 1995, after knowing him for about 96 hours, or 4 days.[81] They wed on a beach, with Anderson in a bikini. Anderson's mother did not know, and learned of the marriage from People magazine. During this time, she was known professionally as Pamela Anderson Lee. They have two sons together: Brandon Thomas (born June 5, 1996)[82] and Dylan Jagger (born December 29, 1997).[83] During their tumultuous marriage, Lee was arrested for spousal abuse after assaulting Anderson. He was sentenced to six months in the Los Angeles County Jail.[84] The couple divorced in 1998.[85]
In March 2002, Anderson publicly stated that she had contracted hepatitis C by sharing tattoo needles with Lee, and began writing a regular column for Jane magazine. In October 2003, Anderson jokingly said on Howard Stern's radio show that she does not expect to live more than 10 or 15 years,[86] but this was misconstrued and taken seriously by many websites and tabloids. As of 2015, Anderson was cured of hepatitis C.[87]
After the 1998 divorce, Anderson became engaged to the model Marcus Schenkenberg; they broke up in 2001. She then became engaged to the singer Kid Rock (Robert J. Ritchie); she broke up with him in 2003. On July 18, 2006, it was announced that she would marry Kid Rock on July 29, 2006, on a yacht near Saint-Tropez, France. "Feels like I've been stuck in a time warp," said Anderson in her blog entry. "Not able to let go of MY family picture ... it's been sad and lonely and frustrating ... I've raised my kids alone in hope of a miracle. Well my miracle came and went. And came back and back because he knew that I'd wake up one day and realize that I was waiting for nothing." "I'm moving on," she declared. "I feel like I'm finally free ... I'm in love." There was extensive unconfirmed media speculation that the marriage was pregnancy-related, but the theory was based only on Anderson's representative's refusal to comment on the question.[88]
On November 10, 2006, it was announced that Anderson had miscarried while in Vancouver shooting a new film, Blonde and Blonder.[89] Seventeen days later, on November 27, 2006, Anderson filed for divorce in Los Angeles County Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences.[90] Some news reports have suggested that Kid Rock's outrage during a screening of Borat, in which Anderson has a cameo role, led to the filing for divorce two weeks later.[91]
In February 2007, Anderson said that she often had sex with Lee since their divorce.[92] In June 2008, Lee said that they were trying again to make things work together.[93]
In September 2007, Anderson stated on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that she was engaged. On September 29, Anderson and film producer Rick Salomon applied for a marriage license in Las Vegas.[94] On October 6, 2007, Anderson married Salomon in a small wedding ceremony at The Mirage, between her two nightly appearances at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Hans Klok's magic show.[95] The couple separated on December 13, and on February 22, 2008, Anderson requested through the courts that the marriage be annulled, citing fraud.[96]
In October 2013, Anderson stated on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that she and Salomon were "friends with benefits". In January 2014, she announced that she had remarried Salomon on an unspecified date.[97] Anderson filed for divorce from Salomon in February 2015.[98] The divorce was finalized on April 29, 2015.[99]
Anderson began dating French footballer Adil Rami in 2017. As of late-June 2019, Anderson declared on an Instagram post, that the relationship with Rami is over.[100]
A sex tape of Anderson and Tommy Lee on their honeymoon was stolen from their home in 1995 and made a huge stir on the Internet. Anderson sued the video distribution company, Internet Entertainment Group. Ultimately, the Lees entered into a confidential settlement agreement with IEG. Thereafter, the company began making the tape available to subscribers to its web sites again, resulting in triple the normal traffic on the sites.[101] Another tape, which was made before the Tommy Lee tape, involving Anderson and musician Bret Michaels from Poison, was later announced, and an abridged version of less than 60 seconds appeared on the internet. Frames of the video first appeared in Penthouse magazine in March 1998. The tape was successfully blocked by Michaels, but a four-minute sex tape is still available on the Internet.[citation needed]
Anderson became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 2004, while retaining her Canadian citizenship.[102][103] Anderson purchased a beach home in Malibu, California, for $1.8 million in 2008 and attempted to sell it in 2013 for $7.75 million, but later took it off the market.[104] Since then, she is renting out her Malibu home for $50,000[105] per month and moved to the French Riviera, mainly because of her relation with the football player Adil Rami. Anderson previously lived in a mansion in Cassis, in the commune of Marseille, France.[106][107] As of July 25, 2019, Anderson said she was again living in her home country after "recently moving back to my beautiful native Canada." and later revealed that she's residing on Vancouver Island.[108][109]
Anderson is a vegan, an advocate for animal rights, and an active member of the animal protection organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), taking part in several campaigns for animal rights.[110][111] She became a vegetarian in her early teens when she saw her father cleaning an animal he had hunted.[112]
