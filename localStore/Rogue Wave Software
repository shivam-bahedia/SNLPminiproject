Rogue Wave Software is an American software development company based in Louisville, Colorado. It provides cross-platform software development tools and embedded components for parallel, data-intensive, and other high-performance computing (HPC) applications.
The company was founded in 1989 in Seattle, Washington, producing a C++ class library in 1989 called Math.h++. In 1990, they moved to Corvallis, Oregon, and released Tools.h++, which predated the Standard Template Library. In November 1996, they had an initial public offering, listing their shares on the NASDAQ under symbol RWAV. In 2001, the ".h++" products were combined into the product family SourcePro C++. In 2003, the company was acquired by Quovadx, which was in turn acquired by private equity firm Battery Ventures in July 2007.
Rogue Wave Software then became an independent company again. In 2009, the company acquired Visual Numerics, developer of IMSL Numerical Libraries and PV-WAVE data analytics software,[2] and TotalView Technologies, Inc (formerly Etnus, Inc.),[3][4] which provides debugging tools for C, C++ and Fortran (TotalView, MemoryScape and ReplayEngine).
In 2010, the company acquired Acumem,[5] a multicore performance software company and developer of performance optimization software, ThreadSpotter. In May 2012, they acquired IBM's ILOG C++ visualization products, followed by their Java and Flex visualization products in September 2014.
In August 2013, the company acquired OpenLogic,[6] and Klocwork in January 2014.[7] With expanding business scope and need for new hires, in October 2015, Rogue Wave moved from Boulder to a somewhat larger and newer space in Louisville, closer to the Denver talent pool;[8] it also acquired Zend Technologies,[9] a maker of PHP tools and services. In November 2016, Rogue Wave Software announced the acquisition of Akana,[10] a leading API management software vendor. In November 2017, the company acquired ZeroTurnaround,[11] creator of Java developer tools for profiling and deployment.
In January 2019, the company was acquired by Minneapolis-based application software developer Perforce.[12]
Rogue Wave products currently include: Akana, Klocwork, Zend Server and Studio, CodeDynamics, TotalView for HPC, IMSL Numerical Libraries, HostAccess, HydraExpress, PV-WAVE, SourcePro, JRebel and Stringray, as well as a portfolio of visualization products.
