Alkiviades David was born in May 1968,[5] in Lagos, Nigeria, to a trading and shipping family of Greek Cypriot origin.[6] His father, Andrew A. David (1934-2000), was born in Petra, Cyprus and went on to study business at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. In 1957, Andrew A. David joined the family business, the Leventis-David Group in Ghana, where he managed Coca-Cola Bottling Plant in Accra.[7]
David attended high school in Switzerland[8] and studied film at the Royal College of Art.[citation needed]
In 1998, he co-founded the London modeling agency Independent Models, whose models included Helena Christensen.[9]
In 2006, David partnered with veteran film producer Elliott Kastner to launch 111 Pictures Ltd., a UK-based independent production and international sales company.[citation needed] Also that year, David started FilmOn, an online streaming site.
He has appeared in films, including a 2008 motion picture, The Bank Job, in which David played a bank-vault expert hired by Jason Statham to help with a bank heist.[9]
He founded the nonprofit organization BIOS to conserve, protect, and educate people on marine conservation around the Greek islands.[citation needed]

David's projects include:
FilmOn, a video on-demand website and mobile service which is an extension of his 111Pix distribution venture.[13]
BattleCam.com, a peer-to-peer video streaming website and community[14] whose offerings including Fight Night and other pay-per-view tournaments built around mixed martial arts, gaming and comedy.[14] David advertised for this venture by offering cash to the first person who streaks in a legal manner in front of US President Barack Obama,[9] and by hosting a faked assisted suicide.[15]

CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox Broadcasting and their studios won a temporary restraining order against David's FilmOn in November 2010 to prevent unlicensed use of their broadcast signals. David sued CBS, dropped the suit, and sued CBS Interactive in November 2011, alleging copyright infringement due to the CNET website having editorially covered infringing uses of peer-to-peer file-sharing software.[9][18][19][20] In June 2013, David filed a countersuit against the four networks seeking a ruling that providing Internet technology for receiving over-the-air broadcast signals at no charge does not violate broadcasters' copyrights.[21]
In April 2019 a jury decided David should pay $11 million in damages to a woman who accused him of sexual assault, including $8 million in punitive damages and $3 million in compensatory damages.
The woman accused David of firing her after she turned down his sexual advances and alleged he groped her in the workplace. Her complaint also accused him of showing lewd photos to employees and hiring a stripper in the workplace.[22]
