Miranda Caroline Raison (born 18 November 1977) is an English screen and stage actress.
Miranda Raison was born in Burnham Thorpe, Norfolk on 18 November 1977.

She is the granddaughter of cricketer Max Raison and the niece of politician Timothy Raison. She is the great-granddaughter of Thomas William Coke, 4th Earl of Leicester and the great niece of Thomas William Coke, 5th Earl of Leicester.
Her parents divorced when she was five years old. From a young age she attended five boarding schools, including Gresham's School, Felixstowe College and Stowe School; her education was paid for by her grandfather.[2][3][4]
It was at Felixstowe College where she cemented an interest in acting; she moved there after experiencing bullying at her previous school.[5] She trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art.[6]
In 1999, she played the role of June Stanley in the play The Man Who Came to Dinner.[7]
In 2000, Raison played Desdemona in William Shakespeare's Othello at the Theatre Royal, York.[8]

From 2002–3, she appeared as Ben-Hur's love interest in a minimalist production of the eponymous play at the Battersea Arts Centre.[11] Later in 2003, she was featured in Pains of Youth, again at the Battersea Arts Centre, playing the death obsessed bisexual Desiree;[12] Lyn Gardner of The Guardian described her performance as making "Desiree's death wish seem tragic rather than merely silly."[13]
In 2010 she played the title role in Anne Boleyn, a new play by Howard Brenton (who had also been involved in scripts for BBC's Spooks’’ in which Raison went on to appear in 5 series) which premiered at Shakespeare's Globe on 24 July 2010 to high critical acclaim.

In 2003, she was featured in the TV comedy film The Private Life of Samuel Pepys as Deb Wilet.
In 2005, she landed a role in Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo, which she described as that it "may as well have been the most brutal Lars von Trier film. Another actress and I actually spent a whole night just crying." She called the experience "regrettable from start to finish" and a "hideous, hideous moment and a great lapse of judgement on my part."[20]
Raison's breakthrough role was as Jo Portman (2005–2009) in the BBC One television drama series Spooks (also broadcast under the title MI-5). She requested that the production company let her go in 2009 as she felt that her character could not develop further and wanted to follow up on theatre opportunities.[21]
