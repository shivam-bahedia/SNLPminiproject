Woodrow Tracy Harrelson (born July 23, 1961) is an American actor and playwright. He first became known for his role as bartender Woody Boyd on the NBC sitcom Cheers (1985–1993), for which he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series from a total of five nominations. He has also received three Academy Award nominations: Best Actor for The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996) and Best Supporting Actor for The Messenger (2009), and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017).[1]
Woodrow Tracy Harrelson[2][3] was born in Midland, Texas, on July 23, 1961,[4] the son of secretary Diane (née Oswald; * 1940)[5] and convicted hitman Charles Voyde Harrelson (1938–2007).[4] He and his two brothers, Jordan and Brett, were raised in a Presbyterian household.[4][6] Their father received a life sentence for the 1979 killing of Federal Judge John H. Wood Jr.[7] Harrelson has stated that his father was rarely around during his childhood.[6] Charles died in the United States Penitentiary, Administrative Maximum Facility on March 15, 2007.[7] Harrelson's family was poor and relied on his mother's wage.[6] In 1973, he moved to his mother's native city of Lebanon, Ohio,[8] where he attended Lebanon High School, from which he graduated in 1979.[9] He spent the summer of 1979 working at Kings Island amusement park.[10] He attended Hanover College in Hanover, Indiana, where he joined the Sigma Chi fraternity. He received a BA in theater and English in 1983.
While attending Hanover, he crossed paths with future Vice President Mike Pence, later commenting in 2018: "I knew him, yeah. We were both very religious. It was a Presbyterian college at the time, and I was there on a Presbyterian scholarship, and he was involved with the church activities. I was actually considering being a minister and then I just kind of went a different way... I actually quite liked him. I thought he was a pretty good guy. He's, you know, very religious. Very committed. Seeing as how I'm not quite in that ballpark now, I don't know how we'd get along, 'cause I think he's still quite religious and just a whole different brand of religious. That kind of fervor that you really don't want."[11]
Harrelson is widely known for his work on the NBC sitcom Cheers. He played bartender Woody Boyd, who replaced Coach (played by Nicholas Colasanto, who died in February 1985). He joined the cast in 1985 in season four, spending the final eight seasons (1985–1993) on the show. For this role, Harrelson was nominated for five Emmy Awards,[12] winning once in 1989.

Harrelson told Playboy in October 2009, "I was getting into theology and studying the roots of the Bible, but then I started to discover the man-made nature of it. I started seeing things that made me ask, 'Is God really speaking through this instrument?' My eyes opened to the reality of the Bible being just a document to control people. At the time I was a real mama's boy and deeply mesmerized by the church."[62][63]
In a May 2018 interview with Jimmy Kimmel,[11] Harrelson mentioned his study of theology and that he had considered becoming a minister. He explained that he became disillusioned with the church during his studies at college: "I started to see how man-made the Bible was and then I started saying, 'I could put this whole thing on hold for a while...let's just put this whole idea on hold so I can have twenties and thirties of extreme hedonism." He stated that he currently has a belief in God, which he attributed to reading Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda, whom he described as a "man of integrity".
