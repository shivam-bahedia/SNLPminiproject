Amiens (French pronunciation: [amjɛ̃]; Picard: Anmien) is a city and commune in northern France, 120 km (75 mi) north of Paris and 100 km (62 mi) south-west of Lille. It is the capital of the Somme department in Hauts-de-France. The city had a population of 136,105 according to the 2006 census, and one of the biggest university hospitals in France with a capacity of 1,200 beds. Amiens Cathedral, the tallest of the large, classic, Gothic churches of the 13th century and the largest in France of its kind, is a World Heritage Site. The author Jules Verne lived in Amiens from 1871 until his death in 1905, and served on the city council for 15 years.
The town was fought over during both World Wars, suffering much damage, and occupied several times by both sides. The 1918 Battle of Amiens was the opening phase of the Hundred Days Offensive which led directly to the Armistice with Germany. Heavily bombed by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, the city was rebuilt according to Pierre Dufau's plans with wider streets to ease traffic congestion. These newer structures were primarily built of brick, concrete and white stone with slate roofs. The architect Auguste Perret designed the Gare d'Amiens train station and nearby Tour Perret.
Amiens has an important historical and cultural heritage, on which tourism is based. Apart from the cathedral, there is the hortillonnages [fr], Jules Verne House [fr], the Tour Perret, the Musée de Picardie, the zoo [fr], and the quarters of Saint-Leu and Saint-Maurice. A total of 53 monuments are listed in the inventory of monuments historiques, 126 places and monuments listed in the general inventory of cultural heritage [fr], and 263 objects listed in the inventory of monuments historiques. During December, the town hosts the largest Christmas market in northern France. It is known for a few local foods, including "macarons d'Amiens", almond paste biscuits; "tuiles amienoises", chocolate and orange curved biscuits; "pâté de canard d'Amiens", duck pâté in pastry; "la ficelle Picarde", an oven-baked cheese-topped crêpe; and "flamiche aux poireaux", a puff pastry tart made with leeks and cream.
The first known settlement at this location was Samarobriva ("Somme bridge"), the central settlement of the Ambiani, one of the principal tribes of Gaul. The town was given the name Ambianum by the Romans, meaning settlement of the Ambiani people. Amiens was part of Francia from the 5th century. Normans sacked the city in 859 and again in 882. In 1113, the city was recognized by King Louis VI of France and joined to the Crown of France in 1185. In 1597, Spanish soldiers held the city during the six-month Siege of Amiens, before Henry IV regained control. During the 18th and 19th century, the textile tradition of Amiens became famous for its velours. In 1789, the provinces of France were dismantled and the territory was organised into departments. Much of Picardy became the newly created department of Somme with Amiens as the departmental capital. During the industrial revolution, the city walls were demolished, opening up space for large boulevards around the town centre. The Henriville neighbourhood in the south of the city was developed around this time. In 1848, the first railway arrived in Amiens, linking the city to Boulogne-sur-Mer. During the 1870 Battle of Amiens when the Somme was invaded by Prussian forces, Amiens was occupied.
The town was fought over during both the First and Second World Wars, suffering much damage and being occupied several times by both sides. The 1918 Battle of Amiens was the opening phase of the Hundred Days Offensive which led directly to the Armistice with Germany that ended the war. It was heavily bombed by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. The city was rebuilt according to Pierre Dufau's plans with a focus on widening the streets to ease traffic congestion. These newer structures were primarily built of brick, concrete and white stone with slate roofs. The architect Auguste Perret designed the Gare d'Amiens train station and nearby Tour Perret.
Amiens, the regional prefecture of Picardy, is also the prefecture of the Somme, one of the three departments (with Oise and Aisne) in the region. Located in the Paris Basin, across the country the city benefits from a privileged geographical position (proximity to Paris, Lille, Rouen, London and Brussels). At the crossroads of major European routes of movement (A1, A16 and A29), the city is also at the heart of a major rail star.
As the crow flies, the city is 115 kilometres (71 mi) from Paris, 97 kilometres (60 mi) from Lille, 100 kilometres (62 mi) from Rouen, 162 kilometres (101 mi) from Le Havre and 144 kilometres (89 mi) from Reims. At the regional level, Amiens is located 53 kilometres (33 mi) north of Beauvais, 71 kilometres (44 mi) west of Saint-Quentin, 66 kilometres (41 mi) from Compiègne and 102 kilometres (63 mi) from Laon.
In area, it is the third in the Somme, after Crécy-en-Ponthieu and Hornoy-le-Bourg.
The area of the commune is 4,946 hectares (12,220 acres); the altitude varies between 14 and 106 metres (46 and 348 ft).[2]
Amiens is crossed by the main stem of the River Somme and is generally quiet, except during exceptional floods, several weeks long (such as spring 2001). It is also, on its southeastern outskirts, close to Camon and Longueau, the confluence with its main tributary on the left bank (to the south), the Avre. The Selle enters from the northwest of Amiens, with two arms (including the Haute Selle) passing behind the Unicorn Stadium, the exhibition park, the megacity and horse racing track, then passing the end of the Promenade de la Hotoie and the zoo of Amiens, and to the right of the water treatment plant, in front of the island Sainte-Aragone, opposite the cemetery of La Madeleine in Amiens.
The city developed in a natural narrowing of the river at the level of the hortillonnages [fr], due to the advance of the rim of the Picard plateau in Saint-Pierre (ford crossing). The Amiens citadel is built on this limestone butte and Rue Saint-Pierre is a slightly inclined path to leave the city from the north. At this narrowing, a network of narrow canals led to the construction of bridges and buildings including textile mills in the Middle Ages.
The hydrographic network has always been an important asset operated by the city. The river helped shape the identity of the landscape, urban and economic territory. It is around the quarters of Saint-Leu, Saint-Maurice bordering the River Somme and most of the administrative and civil area of the current city centre which the city has developed since antiquity.
The Canal de la Somme dates from the beginning of the 19th century and the bridge at the foot of the citadel was built after World War II.
Amiens has the typical oceanic climate of the north of France, with relatively mild winters, cool summers, and rainfall well distributed throughout the year.
Amiens is a hub between the Île de France and the rest of the north of France; Normandy and Benelux; and France and Great Britain. Amiens is not directly on principal European road and rail arteries, such as the A1 motorway and the Paris-Lille TGV train line, at present.
However, at halfway between the urban areas of Lille and Paris, Amiens has good conditions of service and accessibility, including motorways (at the junction of the A16 and A29).
A regular bus link with the TGV Haute-Picardie station also provides access to the Charles-de-Gaulle Airport station. On the horizon of 2022,[3] the Roissy–Picardie Link will put Amiens 55 minutes from Paris Charles-de-Gaulle Airport and its TGV station.
By train, Amiens is located at:
Since antiquity, Amiens has been a crossroads of important routes. The contemporary city is served by the A16 and A29 autoroutes. The Jules Verne Viaduct, 943 metres (3,094 ft) long, crosses the River Somme to the east of the city and allows circumvention of the city by motorway-type roads. The A16 and A29 autoroutes, the RN1 and the RN25 form a bypass-type motorway around the city that the population has called the Rocade d'Amiens [ring road of Amiens]. Initially constituting national roads which are downgraded today, mostly as departmental roads, the greater urban area of Amiens is served by:
Amiens is served by several motorways:
A16 to Calais via Abbeville and Boulogne-sur-Mer
A16 to Paris via Beauvais
A29 to Rouen and Le Havre via Neufchâtel-en-Bray
A29 to Reims via Saint-Quentin and Laon
The proposed A24 autoroute from Amiens to Lille via Doullens was cancelled in 2006.
According to the urban transport plan [fr] (PDU) approved 19 December 2013 for the period 2013–2023 parking supply is considered abundant in Amiens.[4] Although important, demand for parking is less than what is available (capacity reserves are still 20% minimum: If the road is sometimes saturated, the occupancy rate of the underground parking remains globally less than 100%).[4]
In 2013, the city counted approximately 70,000 public parking spaces, including 8,400 in the city centre and in its immediate vicinity, where 70% of places are paid.[4]
4,400 spaces on highways (1,950 in the inner city, including 1,600 paid)
4,000 spaces in underground parking (620 other new places are programmed in a project for the Gare La Vallée development zone).
The underground car parks in the city centre are organised thus:
As of 2007[update], a residential parking system is deployed in Saint-Anne ward to cope with congestion in the streets by cars of users from the SNCF railway station. During the campaign for the municipal election of 2008, parking was one of the important topics of debate.[5] A year after the change of majority, the Gilles Demailly [fr] team launched a consultation with the population.[6] From 2011, the residential parking was extended to the quarters of Gare-La-Vallée and Riolan, then in 2012 the Noyon and the area east of the Riolan sector. In 2014, 2,600 parking spaces[7] were affected by this system which is designed to allow city residents more parking near their homes, to promote a better rotation of vehicles in the streets and reduce permanent occupation of public space by the cars cluttering the highway.
Amiens was originally served by two tram lines over 10.7 kilometres (6.6 mi), opened in 1887. They intersect at Place Gambetta, one linking La Madeleine Cemetery [fr], the Church of Saint-Acheul, Cagnard bridge, Rue de Noyon and Rue Jules-Barni; the other from the Church of Saint-Pierre at the racecourse, by the streets of Saint-Leu, Frédéric-Petit and Colbert. Electrified in 1899, the network grew to seven lines totaling 19 kilometres (12 mi) in 1906. From 1932, Longueau was linked to Amiens by a bus service. German bombing in 1940 destroyed most of the city center and hit the Jules-Ferry Road tram depot [fr], totally destroying the tram fleet. Only the Longueau bus survived. A few old Parisian buses were also used in an extremely reduced service. These buses as well as the surviving bus were then converted to city gas and equipped with tanks on the roof covered by a huge white dome. This service continued until approximately 1946. There were only two urban lines: An east-west line (Saint-Acheul – Montieres) and a northeast-southwest line (Beauville – road to Rouen). It was decided after the war to serve the city by a trolleybus with one route to Longueau. This was only in part realised, serving Saint-Acheul, Rouen, La Madeleine and Saint-Pierre. In 1964, trolleybuses were abandoned and the bus became ubiquitous in Amiens transportation.[8]
The bus network is today managed by the Ametis mixed economy company [fr], whose network covers Amiens Métropole, the agglomeration of Amiens. The establishment of dedicated bus lanes began in 2006. Former Mayor Gilles de Robien had envisioned the creation of a tram, but the choice of dedicated bus lanes had been preferred for reasons of cost and patronage. His successor, Mayor Gilles Demailly [fr], had been considering the development of a TSCP in the metropolitan area. As a result of numerous studies and conferences, elected representatives voted for the creation of a tram at the municipal Council of 15 November 2012. The project had been endorsed by the Communauté d'agglomération Amiens Métropole on 18 December 2012 and the commissioning of a first north-south tram route [fr] was scheduled for 2018/2019.[9] Following the elections of 2014 [fr], which were a defeat for most municipal and community carriers of the project, the new mayor of Amiens Brigitte Fouré, and by extension the new president of Amiens Métropole Alain Gest, decided to suspend the project at least during the time of their respective mandates, thus applying a campaign promise (the tram was at the heart of debate)[10] and despite a project announcement of trams on tyres (of TVR type).[11][12] Improvement of public transit would then be only by that of the bus network. Indeed, in December of the same year, the Community Council approved funding for a study (the sixth in 20 years)[13] relating to the establishment of a rapid transit bus network [fr] (BHNS), which should enter into service in March 2019, and whose vehicles could be electric.[14]

Amiens has developed two bike services: Buscyclette and Velam [fr].
Buscyclette is a service of rental bikes on demand, created in May 1999. In 2014, nearly 2,400 "green bikes" are available for rent, essentially city bikes but also electric bikes (VAE), folding bicycles and specific bikes (kids bikes, child trailers, mountain bikes, freight bikes, tandems, etc.). The rental period varies from half a day to one year.
Velam [fr] is a bike sharing system (VLS) created on 16 February 2008, an adaptation of the Cyclocity [fr] system managed by JCDecaux, similar to Vélo'v in Lyon and Vélib' in Paris. Vélam [fr] offers 313 bikes distributed every 300 to 400 metres in the centre of Amiens and 26 stations.
In 2012, Amiens Métropole had 100 kilometres (62 mi) of routes for cyclists.[4] Despite the development of a bicycle plan in 1997 which was planning the development of 500 kilometres (310 mi) of equipped cycleways, the network of the territory in terms of paths is still incomplete.
The blueprint of the bicycle facilities of the agglomeration (SDAC) provides, over a period of 10 years (2014–2024),[4] for 188 kilometres (117 mi) of cycle routes and equips 490 sites for the parking of bikes. This plan also includes the deployment of parking facilities over the entire territory of the city, close to the facilities frequented by bikers, as well as cyclist right-turns [fr] at traffic lights or even the maintenance of existing facilities.
There are three railway stations:
Two stations on the Paris-Boulogne and Amiens – Rouen lines:
Connections from these two stations include to Lille via Arras and Douai, to Boulogne via Abbeville, to Paris-Nord via Creil or Compiègne, to Reims via Tergnier, and to Rouen.
A station located on the Paris – Lille line in Longueau serving south of Amiens and the communes of Longueau, Cagny, Boves, etc.
Montieres station [fr], station assigned to the freight traffic, it serves only the industrial zone of Amiens. This station is located on the former railway line of Doullens.
Many regional and extra regional links (Haute-Normandie, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, Champagne-Ardenne and île-de-France) pass through Amiens, especially by TER Picardie.
A station located 45 kilometres (28 mi) from Amiens, the Haute-Picardie TGV station, allows access to the TGV network. It is served by buses from Amiens. Its isolated character earned it the name of gare des betteraves, or gare betteraves, at the time of its construction.[16]

In addition to Amiens – Glisy Aerodrome, bordering the town's eastern edge 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from the centre, there are several airports nearby.
Albert – Picardie Airport is located 20 minutes northeast of the city.
Beauvais-Tillé Airport, the ninth largest French airport by usage, located 45 minutes by car south of the city, and served by a bus service from Amiens.
Lille Airport, reachable by train or by road using the A29 and A1.
Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, reachable by train or by road using the A29 and A1, or A16 and N104. The creation of a railway between Creil and Roissy will put Amiens 55 minutes from Paris Charles de Gaulle airport by 2020.[17]
The Somme canal runs through the town to the English Channel. This canal is linked to the Canal du Nord (Paris to Lille metropolitan area)
Amiens comprises a number of neighbourhoods ("quartiers" in French) with their own characteristics, including Saint-Leu, St-Maurice, Henriville, and Saint-Acheul.
St-Leu is a part of Amiens north of the city centre. It has many older wooden and brick houses and several canals. At the foot of the cathedral, traversed by canals, this picturesque area was largely rehabilitated during the 1990s. It extends to the Somme canal, located more to the north, at the foot of the Coteau Saint-Pierre on which the fortress of Jean Errard [fr], called Citadelle, was built. Historically, it was the poor quarter of the city, where butchers, tanners and dyers gathered.
Amiens University's Faculty of Sciences, present since the 1960s, has been renovated and expanded on occasion. The Faculty of Law and Economics has also been transferred since the mid-1990s from the campus (offset to the south of the city) to its new location at the foot of the cathedral.[note 1] The open-air parking it replaces was a "gap" in the landscape dating from World War II. Nonetheless, it allowed an unobstructed view of the cathedral. Most of the buildings have been renovated and transformed into housing much of which is for students, many of whom are in the quarter.
The area became the heart of the Amiens people's evenings, with many establishments (bars, restaurants, etc.) on Place du Don and Quai Bélu.
At Rue Saint-Leu is found the church, located just between the Faculty of Science and Law-Economy (UPJV).
Two theatres were established in the quarter, that of the Chés Cabotans (puppet shows in the Picard language) and the Maison du Théâtre at the foot of the Saint-Leu Church. There is also La Lune des Pirates, a concert hall.

Located to the west of the Citadelle, and east of the La Madeleine Cemetery [fr], this very old working-class quarter of Amiens, and industrial centre of the 18th century, is undergoing rehabilitation with the construction, rearrangement and renovation of much housing.
Bordered by the Canal de la Somme, it offers a stopover for leisure boats, which must go through a lock.
The walls of the city's former dye factory are now those of the École supérieure d'art et de design d'Amiens [fr] (ESAD) as well as those of the Faculty of Arts. The École supérieure d'ingénieurs en électronique et électrotechnique (ESIEE) is in the same quarter. As the Citadelle, it will be renovated by the architect Renzo Piano to accommodate the university departments (UFR) of letters, of history and geography, of languages, the École supérieure du professorat et de l'éducation [fr] (ESPE), the House of Languages, the House of Research and the University Library in 2015.
The Jardin des plantes [fr], known as the Jardin du Roy within the city, is also located in this quarter.
The Henriville neighbourhood was mostly built during the 19th century after the demolition of the city wall. It lies at the south of the town centre. It has numerous bourgeois houses and townhouses, predominantly in brick, blending architectural styles of the period, including neoclassical, troubadour and neo-Gothic. There are also private mansions, such as the Acloque mansion and the house of Jules Verne.
The Saint-Acheul quarter (IPA: [aʃoel]) existed before Amiens, as people have lived there since prehistoric times. This is where archaeological excavations in the nineteenth century discovered prehistoric tool sets typical of the "Acheulean" prehistorical era, named after this neighbourhood (also spelled Acheulian, pronounced [əˈʃuːliən]). An archaeological garden can be freely visited there.
Not to be confused with the commune of Saint-Acheul situated 37 km (23 mi) to the north, the quarter of Saint-Acheul is the site of a military cemetery from the First World War (1914–1918).
It also contains the Church of Saint-Acheul, and the former normal school of teachers which became the Lycée Robert-de-Luzarches. A number of famous people are buried in the former Saint-Acheul cemetery such as J.-P. Pinchon (creator of Bécassine) and many resistance fighters. Part of the quarter includes a so-called "English neighbourhood," with typical English style houses. At the feet of this area lie the hortillonnages [fr], a marshy area criss-crossed by canals.
Amiens, like other big cities, has its large HLM high-rise tower blocks:
North of the city the quarters du Pigeonnier, which is famous for its weekend market, Messenger, Mozart, Fafet-Brossolette-la Cité, Balzac, Léo Lagrange-Schweitzer, etc.;
Southeast of the city: Victorine-Autier, Philéas Lebesgue, Condorcet, Pierre-Rollin.
West: Etouvie and Montieres (an ecodistrict is provided in this industrial space, where there are buildings of the 19th century, in brick).[18]
East: Saint-Acheul-la-Cité and the Clos de l'Avre.
These areas experience a lot of social troubles and have regularly been the place for riots. The northern quarters were the scene of violent events in 1994, 1999 and 2000 (clashes between several districts of the city and between the neighbourhoods of Amiens and the districts of Creil), in 2006 and 2008 (in the wake of incidents in the Paris suburbs)[citation needed] and more recently in August 2012 following a conflict between youth and the police. The cost of the latest vandalism to occur in the north of Amiens would amount, according to Gilles Demailly [fr], to between four and six million euros. These extremely violent riots caused sixteen police officers to be injured.[19]
An extensive programme of redevelopment of these neighborhoods began recently, demolished HLM tower blocks and new infrastructure have been built, especially for schools. In 2009, the public transport network of the Amiens agglomeration was significantly modified.
In 2009, the total number of dwellings in the municipality was 68,145, while it was 63,201 in 1999.[Insee 1]
Among this housing, 91.7% were primary residences, 1.0% of secondary residences and 7.4% vacant housing. These dwellings were 38.7% of detached houses and 60.2% of apartments.[Insee 2]
The proportion of principal residences, which were the properties of occupants, was 34.0%, down from 1999 (35.3%). The share of empty rented HLM homes (social housing) was also down: 29.0% against 32.5% in 1999, their number decreased from 18,692 to 18,103. However, this percentage remains much greater than the rate of 20% required by the law on solidarity and urban renewal [fr] (SRU) for cities and agglomerations of more than 50,000 inhabitants.[Insee 3]
The identity of the city is strongly marked by the specificity of its housing stock consisting in a large proportion of detached houses, semi-detached, single or bourgeois: the amiénoises. These traditional houses in the suburbs, in brick and floor(s), were intrinsically linked to the expansion of the city during and after the Industrial Revolution.
The amiénoise simple includes a window on the ground floor and floors for attic and basement. It is built on a plot of a few metres wide but is very deep, and includes a garden, forming hearts with green islets and sparse areas. The amiénoise double has two windows at each level. The grandes amiénoises and townhouses rise to at least two floors with large rooms. They can have a gate opening onto a paved courtyard.[20]
The official buildings or mansions regularly use brick façades on a sandstone base, decorated by stone window and door frames.
The Chanoines quarter has stone façades exclusively.
In historic areas such as the Saint-Leu [fr] quarter, façades widely use wood, half-timbered or siding, and wattle and daub.
Amiens 2030: Amiens, in the context of the Communauté d'agglomération Amiens Métropole, is developing a master plan of development called Amiens 2030.[21] This strategic outreach project shapes around priority issues of economic, social and cultural development of the agglomeration. The whole process of reflection will determine the development of the metropolis by the 2030.
La Citadelle [fr]: This flagship project for the agglomeration involves the amalgamation of units of training and research from the University of Picardie in letters, languages, history, geography, philosophy, sociology, psychology and the College teaching and education [fr] (ESPE) on the site of La Citadelle; set of 18 acres (7.3 ha) on the outskirts of downtown. This university construction programme should strengthen regional competitiveness and the development of higher education and research. The project, entrusted to the Italian architect Renzo Piano, provides an opening of the campus on the city and will be accessible to all its inhabitants.
ZAC Gare-la-Vallée: The project must strengthen Amiens in his role as regional capital and allow the creation of a genuine business district in the heart of the city. With a budget of €157 million, the project combines tertiary activities, shops and habitat walk from the station and the inner city. The first buildings were inaugurated in 2008. A second phase of development extends from 2012 to 2017. Under the control of the Chief Architect, Paul Chemetov, the quarter must especially accommodate 2,000 homes, 200,000 square metres (2,200,000 sq ft) of offices and two urban parks creating a visible link between downtown, the Somme and the Hortillonnages [fr].[22]
ZAC Intercampus: This new housing and services quarter in the south of the city is to host 1,900 housing by 2030.[23] A first tranche of 850 dwellings must be delivered in 2015. Located in the immediate vicinity of the campus and the CHU d'Amiens, it will be served by a future TCSP. The ecodistrict of 80 hectares (200 acres) must provide beautiful green spaces and gardens (60% of its total area will be not be built). It will include 12 hectares (30 acres) of gardens.[24]
ZAC Paul Claudel: This new housing and services quarter of 40 hectares (99 acres) is located at the southern entrance to the city. Intended as a small neighbourhood, it must accommodate 1,400 units and 1,800 square metres (19,000 sq ft) of commercial space. Designed in 4 slices, together with its inhabitants, it entered the final phase of development in 2013.[25]
ZAC Renancourt: This new quarter must ensure the development of the city to the west. Located between the Grâce Valley, the Selle Valley, the Renancourt quarter and its suburb, this planning area is a natural viewpoint over the city. It is also adjacent to emblematic facilities of the city: The Zenith of Amiens, the Stade de la Licorne and the megacity [fr]. By 2018, this residential area must accommodate 1,400 houses but also a hotel, facilities and shops.[26]
Bus rapid transit (BRT): A project of three BRT lines is under consideration for commissioning in 2019, at the end of two years of work. Estimated at €85 million excluding taxes for 44 kilometres (27 mi), the project would include the construction of a new bus depot and four park and ride stops.[27] This project follows the cancellation of a tram project, which was endorsed by the municipal team in place between 2008 and 2014.
The toponym is derived from the name of the local Gallic people, the Ambiani, which replaced in the 4th century the old name of the town Samarobriva [fr] (the bridge on the Samara – Somme). Amiens then became the episcopal headquarters.[28] In Picard, Amiens is called Anmyen.
The number of inhabitants at the last census being between 100,000 and 149,999, the number of members of the municipal council is 55.[29]
As a result of the French municipal elections of 2014, the distribution of seats is as follows:
Amiens is divided into seven cantons:
Amiens is divided into two legislative districts:
1st district of the Somme [fr] (including Amiens II North-West, Amiens IV East, Amiens VIII North): Pascal Demarthe (PS) (he succeeded Pascale Boistard, named Secretary of State for the rights of women of the Second Valls Government on 26 August 2014)
2nd district of the Somme [fr] (including Amiens I West, Amiens III North-East, Amiens V South-East, Amiens VII South-West, Amiens VI South): Barbara Pompili (EELV)
On 4 April 2014, Brigitte Fouré (IDU (NC)) succeeded Gilles Demailly [fr] (PS). Her list was elected in the second round on 30 March 2014 with 50.39% of the votes.[31]
Amiens is a city marked by a strong judicial tradition, with the historical presence of its Court of Appeal, the Cour d'appel d'Amiens [fr], as well as all courts of first and second degree of judicial order [fr]. The Court of Appeal of Amiens has jurisdiction over the three departments of Picardy, with nine high courts [fr].
More recently, Amiens has become the seat of:
The national court of disability and the pricing of insurance for work accidents [fr].[32]
An administrative tribunal [fr] whose rulings may be appealed [fr] to the administrative court of appeal [fr] of Douai.

According to the official database of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated 11 November 2013, Amiens is twinned with four municipalities, with Nafplio not listed:[33]
Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany[34] since 1960. It was the first Franco-German pairing formalised in France.[35] Exchanges are artistic and cultural.
Görlitz, Saxony, Germany[34] since 1971.

From 2014, the four sites were gradually gathered on the current site of the South Hospital, with the exception of the long stay units for the elderly remaining in the Saint-Victor Centre. This merger will be completed in 2016 and allow the CHU of Amiens to increase its national and inter-regional dimension. This group represents the largest hospital construction of France and one of the most important in Europe (more than €630 million of work and equipment). At the end of the work, the total space of the CHU of Amiens will be 172,000 square metres (1,850,000 sq ft). It will count three blocks of hospitalisation with 400 beds each.

The city is famous for its Notre-Dame Cathedral, masterpiece of Gothic art and the largest cathedral in the world by its interior volume (200,000 cubic metres (7,100,000 cu ft)).[74] The largest religious and medieval building of France, its interior could twice hold Notre Dame de Paris.[75]
The cathedral measures 145 metres (476 ft) long and its spire rises 112 metres (367 ft) high. The vaults of the central nave, finished in 1247, are 42.3 metres (139 ft) (close to the maximum limit for this architecture).
Dating back to the 13th century, its construction is due to the wealth of the city in the Middle Ages and the fire of the Romanesque cathedral which stood previously. Three architects, including Robert of Luzarches succeeded to complete the construction.
Amiens Cathedral is notable for the coherence of its plan, the beauty of its three-tier interior elevation, the particularly fine display of sculptures on the principal façade and in the south transept, and other inlays of its floor. It is also described by John Ruskin as "Gothic, clear of Roman tradition and of Arabian taint, Gothic pure, authoritative, unsurpassable, and unaccusable."
Regarded as the archetype of the classic Gothic style, the cathedral also presents some elements of the radiant Gothic style and flamboyant Gothic. The speed of construction, barely 70 years for the shell (1220 to 1269), explains this remarkable homogeneity of style. Its façade is decorated with more 3,000 statues, gargoyles and chimeras.
Registered since 1981 as a World Heritage Site of UNESCO as a "masterpiece of world heritage", it is a second time in 1998 as a monumental step on the Camino de Santiago. Despite the two World Wars of the 20th century, which severely affected the city, it managed to stay intact.

Its origin dates back to the establishment of the commune of Amiens by Louis VI. It is mentioned for the first time in an arbitral award issued by the chapter of Amiens in 1244.
Symbolising the independence of the commune, it was formerly used for meetings of the notables of the city and then as archive rooms, weapons store and prison. A spotter nearby monitored arrivals and warned the population of the external dangers. During the Middle Ages, the building was repeatedly engulfed by fire.
The belfry is composed of a base in white cut stone, built in the 15th century between 1406 and 1410, a stone superstructure bell tower built from 1749 with Baroque volutes at its base, and a dome covered with slate and then an arrow and a weather vane with a renown. At the time, a huge 11-ton bell was installed inside, it was later destroyed along with the dome (as a result of the melting of the copper component) in the bombardment and fire of the city on 19 May 1940. Abandoned and devoid of a roof since World War II, the monument was fully restored between February 1989 and July 1990.
Located on the Place au Fil, the old central square of the city before the arrival of the railway and the rise of the Rue des Trois Calloux, the belfry is adjacent to Les Halles and the back of the city hall.[77] At a height of 52 metres (171 ft), it rings every hour of the day.
Since July 2005, the belfry of Amiens (recorded in the inventory of Historic Monuments) is, as Notre Dame Cathedral, classed among the world heritage of UNESCO.
In 1845, the traditional fair of Saint-Jean, formerly held at Place René Goblet, was transferred to Place Longueville, a wide esplanade taking the place of the Longueville bastion since the demolition of the walls of the city in the early 19th century. Each year, a temporary circus was established on this occasion.
In 1865, a circus company emerged to claim a permanent circus, which would be built in wood by the Schytte contractor in 1874. However, expensive maintenance prompted the municipality to consider the construction of a new building. The decision was taken in 1886 under the leadership of Mayor Frédéric Petit and the work began.
The Chief Architect of the Somme, Émile Ricquier [fr], a disciple of Gustave Eiffel, was responsible for its construction. It was inspired by the Cirque d'hiver of Paris but chose a cast metal frame, supplemented by brick from the local countryside. The architect of civil buildings, Charles Garnier, claimed that the frames should be hidden with a plaster imitating stone. The "moderninst" design of Ricquier, who chose to display the structure, and to favour local material such as brick, is visible at the rear of the monument.
With its 16-sided polygonal shape, with a diameter of 44 metres (144 ft), it includes lodges and stalls in its enclosure. Modern, it hosts two steam engines dedicated fully electric lights and central heating. Since its construction, it has also been the first circus which included a buffet and a refreshment bar. The cost of the construction of the building finally reached double the forecast.[78] In 1888, the new city councillor responsible for festivals and celebrations, Jules Verne, was responsible for monitoring the work, and it was he who opened it on Sunday 23 June 1889, for the opening of the fair and the centenary of the French Revolution:[79]
The roof was damaged by a shell in 1916. The circus was the setting for Federico Fellini's The Clowns (1971), and the film by Jean-Jacques Beineix, Roselyne et les lions (1989), with Isabelle Pasco as lead actress. The largest of the circuses of the province with its 3,000-seats, the building has acquired a multidisciplinary use for decades of performances of theatre, dance, concerts, galas, sports and public meetings.
Renovated in 2003, it now bears the name of Cirque Jules Verne. After hosting the performances of Cirque Rancy [fr], it hosts resident Cirque Arlette Gruss [fr].
Since 1 January 2011, the circus has been labelled "national hub circus and street arts", managed by an EPCC [fr]. It is one of seven in France and is still in use today.[80]
In 1882, Jules Verne and his wife, Honorine, rented the house at the corner of Rue Charles-Dubois and Boulevard Longueville until 1900. Acquired in 1980 by the city, the house is labeled Maisons des Illustres by the Ministry of Culture. Restored in 2006, thanks to the work of the Centre international Jules-Verne [fr], this 19th-century mansion, listed in the supplementary inventory of historic monuments [fr], traces through the exhibition of more than 700 objects, the personality, the sources of inspiration and memories of Jules Verne.
Opposite the Gare d'Amiens, the neighborhood was rebuilt after having been razed by bombing in 1944, is located the Tour Perret (from the name of its architect Auguste Perret). Over 100 metres (330 ft) high, it was one of the first skyscrapers built in Europe, and the highest for a long time.[81]
This church was built at the end of the 15th century, on the model of the hall-churches. It is dedicated, as its district, to Saint Leu, referring to the 7th century bishop who was exiled to the Vimeu. It has three naves. A flamboyant portal adorns the base of the steeple. The latter, struck by lightning, had to be rebuilt at the beginning of the 16th century. The ends of beams are carved. Stone and wood statues date from the 17th century. The choir houses the glory of the Duthoit brothers.
Numerous archaeological excavations have uncovered remains from proto-historic times to the Roman era. Two skylights cut in the last development of Place Gambetta allow observation of a few remains of the forum while important remnants of a large Gallo-Roman theatre uncovered in early 2007 have been dismantled and stored in accordance with the rules of archaeological conservation, during the redevelopment of the Gare quarter (March 2007).[82]

Amiens is also known for the hortillonnages [fr], gardens on small islands in over 300 hectares (740 acres) of marshland between the River Somme and River Avre, surrounded by a grid network of man-made canals (locally known as "rieux"). They are also known as the "floating gardens of Amiens".[107] The hortillonnages are sometimes called "Little Venice of the North", because of the canals.
Hortillon means market garden in Picard, and derives from the Latin hortillus, small garden. It is circulated in flat bottom boats, formerly called barque à cornet [Cornet boat], due to the very raised front, which allows the boats to easily dock on the fragile shores of the cultivated fields. It is the port of upstream, located at the foot of the cathedral where a weekly market is held on the water, although the arrival by boat of the growers can be accomplished only once a year, in summer.

The Fonds régional d'art contemporain of Picardie (FRAC Picardie), created in 1983, aims the promotion of contemporary art in partiular through dissemination actions. As early as 1985, FRAC Picardie had specialised its action in the field of the design and its contemporary dimensions. It is also interested in the media, on and off paper, since artists are now working through the video medium. This allowed it to acquire a good reputation in France and abroad.[121] In 30 years, the FRAC has brought together a unique collection of a thousand drawings which include major names of contemporary art, such as Basquiat, Dubuffet, Oppenheim, Twombly, Matta, Manessier, etc.[122] Since 2001, discussions are underway to construct a new building to accommodate the fonds and its collections.[123]

Amiens saw rise, over the centuries, major writers.[158] In the first half of the 17th century, Vincent Voiture, poet and letter writer, was the darling of the Précieuses for the fluidity of his style. In 1634, he was member of the 1st Académie française. In 1678, Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange, nicknamed "the French Varro", published his Glossarium in 3 volumes. This glossary of medieval Latin is still authoritative today. In 1750, Jean Baptiste Gresset, playwright and poet, celebrated in his time and member of the Académie française, founded the Academy of Amiens [fr] which is still active today and he was named perpetual president.
In 1782, the Amiens native Choderlos de Laclos published Les Liaisons dangereuses where he staged a depraved nobility. Considered one of the masterpieces of 18th-century literature, the book has toured the world and is known as an Oscar-winning film adaptation.
In the 19th century, there was a brilliant literary life around the Académie des sciences, des lettres et des arts d'Amiens [fr] with historian Albéric de Calonne and the Yvert family. However, the great name of Amiens literary life is Jules Verne. He animated all intellectual activity, giving balls and parties, while his wife held a famous salon. He often attended the library of the industrial society, which subscribed to numerous scientific journals. A member of the Academy of Sciences, Letters and Arts of Amiens from 8 March 1872, he was elected Director in 1875, and in 1881 and, on this occasion, he delivered several speeches of welcome, especially for one of his friends, Amiens cartoonist Gédéon Baril [fr], who signed illustrations of Dix heures en chasse [fr] with Hetzel. Engaged in local life, he was Councillor of Amiens from 1888 to 1904. He was closely interested in the affairs of the city, wrote many reports on the theatre and brought its support to the construction of the municipal circus [fr].
Amiens does appear explicitly in his novels but there are however characteristic elements of the city such as the cathedral and the river. This is the case, for example, for the imaginary city of Ragz in Le secret de Wilhem Storitz. In the novel Une fantaisie du docteur Ox, the inhabitants of the fictional town of Virgamen, the Virgamenois, refer directly to the Amiénois and their prudent nature.[159]
In 1875, he delivered before the Academy of Sciences, Letters and Arts of Amiens a speech entitled "An ideal city: Amiens in the year 2000" where he portrays himself wandering in a forward-thinking city of Amiens. Since then, the city has built a tourist route from this text.
He died in Amiens in 1905, and he deeply marked the town's footprint, so that today many places, monuments and events bear his name. He rests at La Madeleine cemetery [fr] where one can read on his tomb: Vers l'immortalité et l’éternelle jeunesse. [Towards immortality and eternal youth].
In 1885, Englishman John Ruskin published the Bible of Amiens, which was translated into French, extensively annotated and prefaced, in 1904, by Marcel Proust. This book dedicated to Notre-Dame d'Amiens was the opportunity for Proust to recall his admiration for the English author and the Cathedral of Amiens.
In the second half of the 19th century, Jules Barni [fr], Member of Parliament for the Somme [fr], Associate Professor of philosophy and brilliant scholar translated Kant's work in French and thus enabled its dissemination in France.
A native of Amiens, Paul Bourget published Le Disciple [fr] in 1889, novel today considered his major work. He was elected, 5 years later, to the Académie française.
Born in Sainte-Anne district in 1885, Roland Dorgelès published Les Croix de bois [fr] in 1919. A masterpiece written from his notes taken at the Front, the novel won the Prix Femina the same year. Though capable of obtaining the Prix Goncourt, it was beaten by À l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs [fr] of Marcel Proust, 6 votes against 4. A member of the Académie Goncourt in 1929, he was elected president in 1954 until his death in 1973.[160]
In 1926, the Amiens native Henri Deberly, won the Prix Goncourt with Le Supplice de Phèdre [fr], a novel inspired by his home city.

Amiens is a stronghold of comics in France. A whole generation of designers and Amiens writers make the city an important creative centre of the 9th art. The main actors in this generation, include Régis Hautière [fr], Norédine Allam [fr] who notably led the recolouring of the 33 Asterix albums in the framework of the project "The great collection" and also Antoine Dodé [fr], David François [fr], Fraco, Hardoc [fr], Greg Blondin, Nicolas Hitori De, etc.[164]
The city was also the birthplace or home of big names in the comic strip universe, such as the Amiens native Joseph Pinchon, creator of the character of Bécassine; Paul Gillon, winner of the Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême and also Philippe Thirault [fr].
Actor of this dynamic around the BD, the association On a marché sur la bulle [Explorers on the bubble] organises the Rendez-vous de la bande dessinée d'Amiens [fr], one of the greatest French comic book festivals.[165] Active throughout the territory, the structure also manages a resource centre and has an editorial department with the Éditions de la Gouttière [fr].
Chés Cabotans d'Anmien or the Cabotins of Amiens is a small Picardy traditional puppet theatre founded in 1933. Lafleur [fr], the hero, was created around 1811 at Saint-Leu [fr]. He talks in Picard, exclusively. Traditionally a lackey costume (wearing a red velvet tricorne hat) dressed, Lafleur is cheerful, dynamic, independent and resourceful; its motto is: "bin mier, bin boere, pis did rin foere!" (Drink well, eat well and then do nothing).
The Picard language is recognised regional language. It is spoken in France in the Picardy and Nord-Pas-de-Calais regions, and in Belgium in the Province of Hainaut. Various associations work for the promotion and development of Picardy culture expressed in theatre, song, in spoken tales but also in writing: Novels, journals, poetry, etc. Since 1993, the Conseil régional de Picardie [fr] has developed within the "Office Culturel Régional de Picardie" a cultural policy for the language and the Picardy culture. "The Agency for Picard", created in 2008, is headquartered in Amiens.[166] Picard is taught at the University of Amiens.
The blasons populaires are surnames or the nicknames given to the inhabitants of cities and the Picardy villages. These surpitchets sometimes come from the history of the city, sometimes a verbal game, sometimes through a mockery of people. The nickname of the inhabitants of Amiens is: Chés Maqueus d'gueugues d'Anmien [Amiens nut eaters] in reference to an episode of the Spanish invasion. On 11 March 1597, the Spanish armies developed a ploy to seize the city: The soldiers of Hernán Tello de Portocarrero, Governor of Doullens, disguised as peasants, came to the gates of the walls with nuts. The Amiens hungry then opened the doors and the Spaniards took the city.
During December, the town hosts the largest Christmas market in northern France.[167] Amiens, in the image of the Picardy region, has a rich gastronomic heritage.[168] Here are some of the specialities:[169]
Amiens is known for a few local foods, including "macarons d'Amiens", small, round-shaped biscuit-type macaroons made from almond paste, fruit and honey, which were first recorded in 1855;[170] "tuiles amienoises" [fr], chocolate and orange curved "tuiles" or biscuits; Pâté de canard d'Amiens [fr] – duck pâté in pastry, made since the 17th century;[171] and "la ficelle Picarde", an oven-baked cheese-topped crêpe with ham and mushroom filling,[167][172] then topped with fresh cream flavoured with nutmeg, white pepper, and sprinkled with grated cheese before being browned in the oven. The region is also known for "flamiche aux poireaux", a puff pastry tart made with leeks and cream.[173]
Other dishes include:
The Summer Rambo apple cultivar originated near Amiens in the 16th century.
In 1991, the municipality formed around Gilles de Robien designed a new logo, incorporating the Fleur-de-lis and the Ivy leaf present on the coat of arms, placed side by side in red with a background of grey or white, depending on usage.
A stamp representing the arms of the city was issued in 1962, this issue fitted into one of the Arms of cities. Its power of postage was five cents. It was issued on 23 January 1962 and withdrawn from sale on 23 January 1977. A first day was arranged in Amiens on 21 July 1962. It was designed by Robert Louis [fr]. Artist Arman made a board collage of this stamp.[190]
