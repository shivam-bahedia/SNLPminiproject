Maksim Mikalaevich "Max" Mirnyi (Belarusian: Максім Мікалаевіч Мірны, pronounced [makˈsʲim ˈmʲirnɨ]; Russian: Максим Николаевич Мирный, pronounced [mɐkˈsʲim ˈmʲirnɨj]; born 6 July 1977)[1] is a Belarusian former professional tennis player.
Mirnyi became a doubles specialist following his singles career, in which he reached a career-high of World No. 18 (August 2003) and finished in the top 50 in the world for seven straight years despite only winning one ATP singles title (2003 Rotterdam Open). He represented Belarus in Davis Cup competition from April 1994, where he holds a record of 47 wins and 27 losses in 35 ties played. He reached the World No. 1 doubles ranking in June 2003 and won ten Grand Slam titles: Men's Doubles in the 2000 and 2002 US Open and the 2005, 2006, 2011 and 2012 French Open; and mixed doubles in the 1998, 2007, and 2013 U.S. Opens and 1998 Wimbledon.
At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Mirnyi carried the flag of Belarus at the Opening Ceremony on 27 July 2012,[2] and won the Gold medal in the Mixed Doubles with Victoria Azarenka on 5 August 2012.[3]
Mirnyi won the 1998 US Open and 1998 Wimbledon along with Serena Williams, and lost the final of 1999 Australian Open. His best performance at a Grand Slam in singles came when he got to the quarterfinals of the 2002 US Open, defeating Attila Sávolt, Antony Dupuis, Dominik Hrbatý and Roger Federer before losing to Andre Agassi. In the 2004 Davis Cup, he and Vladimir Voltchkov defeated Russia 3–2 and Argentina 5–0, reaching the semifinals, where they lost to the United States. In 2006, he scored an upset against James Blake at Wimbledon. That same year, he and Jonas Björkman defeated the Bryan brothers in men's doubles at the French Open. In 2011, he and Daniel Nestor defeated Juan Sebastián Cabal and Eduardo Schwank at the French Open. In 2012, he and Daniel Nestor defeated the Bryan brothers, both at the Queen's Club, UK,[4] and again at the French Open.[5][citation needed]
