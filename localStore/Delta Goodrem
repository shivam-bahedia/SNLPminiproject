It was on the List of best-selling albums in Australia, with over four million copies sold.
Goodrem's second album, Mistaken Identity (2004), was created while she was suffering from cancer. It became her second number-one album. In 2007, Goodrem released Delta, her third number-one album, which saw another number-one single, "In This Life". Her fourth studio album, Child of the Universe (2012), produced the single "Sitting on Top of the World". In 2016, her fifth album, Wings of the Wild, became her fourth number-one album on the ARIA Albums Chart, while giving her another number-one single, "Wings".
Goodrem has a total of nine number-one singles and 17 top-ten hits on the ARIA Singles Chart. She has sold over eight million albums globally and overall has won three World Music Awards, 9 ARIA Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award and several other awards. She has served as a coach on The Voice Australia every year since 2012 (except from in 2014), taking home the win in season five in 2016 and again in season six in 2017.
Goodrem was born on 9 November 1984,[1] to Denis and Lea. She has a younger brother, Trent.[2]
Goodrem appeared in an American advertisement aged seven for the Galoob toy company, alongside fellow Australian Bec Cartwright,[3] and began playing piano at the same age while taking up singing, dancing and acting lessons. She appeared in adverts for companies such as Optus and Nesquik, and had several minor roles in episodes of Australian television shows including Hey Dad..!, A Country Practice, and Police Rescue.[4]
While residing at Glenhaven, Goodrem attended the Hills Grammar School in neighbouring Kenthurst, from kindergarten until Year 11. She is known to return to her alma mater for visits.[5]
At the age of thirteen, Goodrem recorded a five-song demo CD, financed through her television work.[6] It was sent to the Sydney Swans (of which Goodrem is a supporter) and they passed it onto Glenn Wheatley,.[7][8] Wheatley signed Goodrem to an artist development deal with independent label, Empire Records.[9] Between June 1999 to September 2000, she worked with producers Paul Higgins and Trevor Carter on thirteen tracks for an album called Delta,[8] which saw "an ambitious 15-year-old keen to emulate the pop sound of the Spice Girls, Britney Spears and Mandy Moore."[10] The album has yet to surface, Goodrem preventing its release years later via civil action in 2004.[9]
At the age of 15, Goodrem signed a record deal with Sony[11] and began work on an album of pop–dance songs including the unsuccessful debut single, "I Don't Care", which peaked at number sixty four on the ARIA Singles Chart in November 2001.[8] The album and proposed second single "A Year Ago Today" were pushed aside as a result, allowing Goodrem and Sony to re-evaluate her future musical direction. In 2002, Goodrem took up the role as shy school girl and aspiring singer Nina Tucker in the popular soap Neighbours, which helped re-launch Goodrem's music career.[12] [13] The piano-based ballad "Born to Try", co-written by Audius Mtawarira, premiered on the show and reached number one on the ARIA Singles Chart and number three in the UK. Born to Try was certified triple Platinum in Australia for sales of over 210,000 copies.[14] Goodrem's role on the show scored her a Logie for "Most Popular New Talent" at the 2003 Logie Awards[15] In January 2003, "Lost Without You" topped the ARIA Singles Chart and reached number four in the UK. it was certified double platinum for sales over 140,000 copies in Australia.[14]
Goodrem's largely self-penned debut album, Innocent Eyes, was released on 24 March 2003 in Australia and debuted at number one on the ARIA Album Charts, breaking Australian records previously held by John Farnham's Whispering Jack (1986) by staying at number one for 29 consecutive weeks, while tying with Neil Diamond's Hot August Night (1972) as the second longest charting number one album with a total of 29 weeks at top spot. It was the highest-selling album in Australia of 2003[16] and sold 1.2 million copies in Australia, and over 4 million worldwide.[17] The album also charted highly in the UK, peaking at number two. The album's third single "Innocent Eyes" again reached number one on the ARIA Singles Chart and number nine in the UK. it was certified Platinum in Australia for sales over 70,000 copies.[14]
On 8 July 2003, at the age of 18, Goodrem was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma.[18] She was forced to put all working commitments on hold while undertaking treatment for the disease. In an exclusive interview with The Australian Women's Weekly, Goodrem revealed that, since 2002, she had suffered from a head-to-toe rash, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and a lump on her neck.[19] "I was doing sit-ups when I felt something pop in my neck. I reached down and I felt a small lump at the base of my throat. It wasn't sore, it wasn't visible, but I could feel it."[19] As part of her treatment, Goodrem undertook chemotherapy, which resulted in the loss of her hair, and radiation therapy.[19] The news of her diagnosis made newspaper and television headlines and an outpouring of support was shown by fans and the general public alike. Goodrem thanked them during The Visualise Tour for all the letters and well wishes she received.
The album's fourth single, "Not Me, Not I", was released following the announcement Goodrem had been diagnosed with cancer. It became her fourth consecutive number one single in Australia, overtaking the previous effort of three number-ones from Kylie Minogue's debut album, Kylie (1988).[20] It was certified Platinum for sales over 70,000 copies.[14] In early August, Goodrem announced she would not renew her contract with Glenn Wheatley. Her mother, Lea Goodrem, replaced him as her manager.[21] Later that month, Goodrem won seven ARIA Awards, including "Best Female Artist", surpassing Natalie Imbruglia's previous record of six awards in 1999.[22] As Delta was too unwell to perform at the ceremony herself, singer Darren Hayes performed a rendition of "Lost Without You" as a tribute, bringing an overwhelmed Goodrem to tears. Her first full-length DVD Delta became the highest-selling music DVD by an Australian artist in Australia ever, with a certification of 11x platinum.[23] The Australian-only release "Predictable" became her fifth consecutive number one on the ARIA Singles Chart in December and was certified double Platinum for sales of over 140,000 copies.[14]
After announcing in late December 2003 that she was in remission, Goodrem began work on her second studio album. Goodrem received two nominations at the 2004 Logie Awards including a Gold Logie nomination for "Most Popular Personality on Australian Television". In September 2004, she became the face of soft drink company Pepsi in Australia, appearing on the product, billboards, TV advertisements and performing an exclusive show for competition winners.[24][25] In October Goodrem launched her own lingerie line titled "Delta by Annabella".[26]
Goodrem's second album Mistaken Identity, was released in Australia on 8 November 2004 and debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums chart. It was certified five times platinum for sales of 350,000 copies.[27] The album spent 46 weeks in the top fifty. It also reached number seven in New Zealand, and peaked at number 25 in the UK. The album's lead single "Out of the Blue", which was co-written and produced by Guy Chambers was released prior to the album on 8 October 2004. "Out of the Blue" debuted at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart and number nine in the UK". This was Goodrem's sixth straight number one single in Australia. It was certified platinum in Australia.[28] The second single "Mistaken Identity" was released only in Australia debuted at number seven and was certified Gold.[29] "Almost Here", a duet with Irish singer Brian McFadden was released as the third single and reached number three in the UK and became her seventh ARIA number one, along with her first number one in Ireland. It was certified platinum in Australia.[29] "A Little Too Late" was released only in Australia and peaked at number 13. "Be Strong" was released as the album's fifth and final single in Australia as a digital download on 17 October 2005. At the time of release, digital downloads were not included as part of the main singles chart, therefore it was ineligible to chart. Much of the album, in particular "Extraordinary Day", was inspired by her battle with cancer.[30] Reflecting on that period of her life, Goodrem said "It's weird to see pictures of that time. In some ways the fact that I was so sick was so out there, and yet I kept it really private. No-one saw me on the days I was really sick. I was 18 when I was diagnosed and I had a number one album and single in the country. And in the UK, I was number two. It was such a bipolar year.[31][32]
In March 2005, Goodrem starred in her first film role in Hating Alison Ashley, a film based on the children's novel by Robin Klein, with Goodrem acting the title character. The film performed poorly at the box office and was not a critical success, with some critics citing Goodrem's performance as too robotic and detached.[33] April 2005 saw Goodrem relocate to New York to launch her career in the United States with a re-worked version of "Lost Without You". She appeared in the last two episodes of the short-lived American series North Shore in a bid to gain greater exposure. "Lost Without You" proved to be modestly successful, peaking at number eighteen on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, but Goodrem was reportedly dissatisfied with its performance. Plans to release a hybrid of her first two albums were later terminated and Goodrem put America on hold. In July, Goodrem embarked on her first headline concert tour of Australia, The Visualise Tour. Ticket prices, $90 each, came under criticism for being higher than most international acts touring Australia at the time and this initially led to slow sales.[34] By the time the concerts were due to take place, many venues sold out after tickets were reduced to $60. Once the tour concluded, over 80,000 tickets had been bought in total making The Visualise Tour one of Australia's highest-selling local tours.[35] The Visualise Tour: Live in Concert was released in November and became Goodrem's second No. 1 DVD.
On 15 March 2006, Goodrem performed a new song, "Together We Are One", at the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony in front of 80,000 spectators and up to 1.5 billion television viewers worldwide. The song, written specifically for the event was released in Australia where it peaked at number two on the ARIA Singles Chart.[36] It was performed by the Top 5 contestants on season five of "American Idol". In June 2006, Goodrem signed to Modest! Entertainment for her worldwide management.[37] In October 2006, Goodrem promoted in Japan with the release of an updated version of Innocent Eyes and the Japan-only single "Flawed", which reached number one on the Japanese download chart. The album peaked at number eight on the Japanese international chart (excluding Japanese artists) and number nineteen on the official Japanese album chart (including Japanese artists). In November, Goodrem appeared with Westlife on UK talent series The X Factor to perform a duet titled "All Out of Love", which appeared on the boyband's ninth LP, The Love Album. She was in Melbourne on Christmas Eve to headline the annual Carols by Candlelight.[38]
Goodrem's third studio album, the eponymous Delta, was released in Australia on 20 October 2007. Goodrem described the material as "...a lot lighter" compared to her previous album Mistaken Identity.[39] She has also stated, "As people become more aware of your life, they can pinpoint what songs are about. On this album, I've tried to remove a lot of that and just write great pop songs, songs that are from my heart but there's no baggage with them".[40][41] The album debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart, making it her third number one album in her home country.[13] and received platinum certification for shipments of 70,000 records, though sales were much lower; only 23,000 copies were sold during the first week. In December the album was certified 2x platinum.[42] It eventually was certified 3x platinum in 2008.[43] In New Zealand, the album debuted at number twelve on the RIANZ Albums Chart.[44]
On 10 August 2007, Goodrem was in Los Angeles to film the music video for the album's lead single "In This Life", which is also the opening theme for the anime Deltora Quest, based on the novels by fellow Australian Emily Rodda. The video premiered on 31 August on Sunrise. "In This Life" was officially released on 15 September. It debuted at number one on the Australian Singles Chart, becoming Goodrem's eighth number one single in Australia. It was certified platinum.[45]

On 24 November 2011, Goodrem was confirmed to be a part of the judging panel of the Australian version of The Voice which aired in early 2012, coaching alongside Keith Urban, Joel Madden, and Seal.[62] Some of Goodrem's decisions on the show sparked criticism, with comments she was "all style" and "little substance".[63] Rachael Leahcar was Goodrem's contestant in the final four. This was after Goodrem chose Leahcar over Glenn Cunningham, who was Goodrem's back up singer on her Believe Again Tour in 2009. Leahcar finished third. Goodrem returned for season two in 2013, again with Madden and Seal, with Ricky Martin replacing Urban. Goodrem's finalist for season two was Celia Pavey who also finished third.[64]

The ASB said that people may not realise that vintage cars are fitted with lap seatbelts which are not clearly seen in the video.
