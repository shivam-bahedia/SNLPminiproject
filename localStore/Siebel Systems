Siebel CRM Systems, Inc. was a software company principally engaged in the design, development, marketing, and support of customer relationship management (CRM) applications. The company was founded by Thomas Siebel and Patricia House in 1993. At first known mainly for its sales force automation products, the company expanded into the broader CRM market. By the late 1990s, Siebel Systems was the dominant CRM vendor, peaking at 45% market share in 2002.[1]
On September 12, 2005, Oracle Corporation announced it had agreed to buy Siebel Systems for $5.8 billion.[2] Siebel is now a brand name owned by Oracle Corporation.
The CRM software development environment is known as Siebel Tools and those skilled in such are known as Siebel Consultants.
Siebel Systems, Inc. began in sales force automation software, then expanded into marketing and customer service applications, including CRM. From the time it was founded in 1993, the company grew quickly. Benefiting from the explosive growth of the CRM market in the late 1990s, Siebel Systems was named the fastest growing company in the United States in 1999 by Fortune magazine.[citation needed]
