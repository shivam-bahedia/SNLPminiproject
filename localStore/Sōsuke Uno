Sōsuke Uno (宇野 宗佑, Uno Sōsuke, 27 August 1922 – 19 May 1998) was a Japanese politician who was briefly Prime Minister of Japan in 1989. A scandal exposed by the Geisha Mitsuko Nakanishi contributed to his premature resignation from office after just sixty-eight days.
Sōsuke Uno was born in Moriyama, Shiga, the son of a successful brewer. He attended the Kobe University of Commerce after serving as an officer in the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. As well as a politician Sōsuke was an accomplished writer, who wrote a book considered classic in Japan about his experiences as a prisoner of war in Siberia.
In 1960 he entered politics, winning election to the Diet of Japan. Six years later he was promoted to Vice-Minister at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, then similar positions with the Science and Technology Agency, then the Administrative Agency until earning his place in Cabinet as Minister for Trade and Industry and then Foreign Secretary until he was Prime Minister. Whilst Foreign Secretary (in what were conflicted times) he was applauded for his tact as foreign secretary, navigating international demands for increased Japanese contributions to international commerce with stern loyalty to his own nation's interests.
In 1974 he served briefly as Director General of the Japan Defense Agency.
Uno's career reached a peak in the most fraught times his party had seen, as he took the reigns of his party after the Recruit Scandal, when 47 Japanese MPs (including mostly other members from his own Liberal Democrat Party) were found guilty of taking bribes and unfair trading. Of all prime-ministerial candidates, only Uno was free of blame from them, and he was given charge over the party, the government, and Japan. By this stage he had served his country for almost fifty years, and was placed in office on 3 June 1989. The prime minister then resigned after 68 days.
Uno encountered a public scandal accused by the Geisha Mitsuko Nakanishi[1][2] who claimed that he was both irresponsible and stingy to support the Geisha during their four-month affair.
The Geisha Nakanishi further declared in public newspapers that he treated older Geisha women with arrogance and contempt. Nakanishi declared that Uno had paid her US$14,000 in 1985, prior to their affair. Uno was accused for not providing the appropriate fee of ¥300,000 per month, (At the time, approximately US$21,000) for her company of four months, which was seen as very poor etiquette within the Geisha community. Their affair ended in March 1986, though Nakanishi maintained that Uno did not provide a traditional parting gift (fee) for her services as is custom in the Geisha etiquette.
A Washington Post article was published later on, bringing international attention to Uno.[3] Accordingly, some Geisha artisans heavily dismissed the whistleblower Geisha, due to compromising the discreet nature of her affair and engaging with political and economical affairs in the public sphere. Nakanishi later quit the Geisha profession, got remarried and divorced, attended a Shingon Buddhist school temple in Shiga Prefecture and held various jobs onwards. Due to the gravity of the scandal associated with their affair, her son also disowned her during that time.
To avoid further scandal, Sōsuke Uno resigned as prime minister in August 1989, but continued to serve his country in various government posts until he retired fully in 1996. On 29 April 1994, he was awarded with the highest possible honour for a non-head-of-state, the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flowers.[4]
At 72 years of age, Sōsuke Uno then enjoyed a peaceful retirement in Moriyama city. He died in 1998 in his home. He published two collections of Haiku poems, as well as his book on prisonership in Siberia, along with painting, poetry, and music. A year later in 1999, his Geisha affair was highlighted in the Secret Life of Geisha, a TV documentary.[5]
