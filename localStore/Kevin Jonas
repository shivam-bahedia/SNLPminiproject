Paul Kevin Jonas II (born November 5, 1987)[1] is an American musician, singer, songwriter, actor, contractor, dancer, and entrepreneur. He rose to fame as a member of the pop rock band, Jonas Brothers, alongside his younger brothers Joe and Nick.
The group released their debut studio album It's About Time through the Columbia label in 2006, which failed to achieve commercial success.
After signing with Hollywood Records, the group released their self-titled second studio album in 2007, which became their breakthrough record.
The band became prominent figures on the Disney Channel during this time, gaining a large following through the network: they appeared in the widely successful musical television film, Camp Rock (2008) and it’s sequel, Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam (2010) as well as two of their own series, Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream (2008–2010) and Jonas (2009–2010).
The band's third studio album, A Little Bit Longer (2008), saw continued commercial success for the group; the album's lead single "Burnin' Up" hit the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Their fourth studio album, while still successful on the Billboard 200 chart, saw a decline in record sales.
After the group confirmed a hiatus, Kevin appeared on his own E! reality series in 2012, Married to Jonas, with his wife Danielle. Since the band's break-up in 2013, Jonas has appeared on the seventh season of The Celebrity Apprentice in 2014, founded a real-estate development and construction company called JonasWerner, and is the co-CEO of The Blu Market company, which deals with communications and plans for social media influencers.
He appeared on People magazine's list of the Sexiest Men Alive in 2008 at the age of 21, and thus included as part of the 21 Club.[2][3]
After the Jonas Brothers announced their reunion in March 2019, the band released their fifth studio album, Happiness Begins, and released their documentary, Chasing Happiness, in June 2019 on Amazon Prime Video.[4][5]
Paul Kevin Jonas II, better known as Kevin Jonas, was born in Teaneck, New Jersey, and grew up in Wyckoff, New Jersey[6] His mother, Denise Marie (née Miller), is a former sign language teacher and singer, and his father, Paul Kevin Jonas Sr., is a songwriter, musician, and former ordained minister at an Assemblies of God church.[7][8][9][10] He has three younger brothers, Joe (born 1989), Nick (born 1992), and Frankie (born 2000).[6]
In early 2005, Columbia Records' new president, Steve Greenberg, listened to Nick's record. While Greenberg did not like the album, he did like Nick's voice.[11] After hearing the song "Please Be Mine", written and performed by all the brothers, Daylight/Columbia Records decided to sign the three as a group act.[12] After being signed to Columbia, the brothers considered naming their group "Sons of Jonas" before settling on the name "Jonas Brothers".[13] It's About Time, the brothers' first album, was released on August 8, 2006.[14] According to the band's manager, it was only a "limited release" of a little over 50,000 copies. Because Sony was not interested in further promoting the band, the Jonas Brothers then considered switching labels. The band was ultimately dropped by Columbia Records in early 2007.[15]
After shortly being without a label, the Jonas Brothers signed with Hollywood Records in February 2007.[16] Around the same time, the brothers began appearing in Gap Inc. commercials for Baby Bottle Pop, singing the jingle. Their self-titled second album, Jonas Brothers, was released on August 7, 2007.[17] It reached number five on the Billboard Hot 200 chart in its first week.[18] Jonas and his brothers guest-starred in an episode of Hannah Montana, titled "Me and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas", which aired August 17, 2007 on Disney Channel. The episode debuted alongside the television film High School Musical 2 and a sneak peek of Phineas and Ferb.[19] The episode broke basic cable records with a record 10.7 million viewers and became basic cable's most watched series telecast ever.[20]
Jonas and his brothers also starred in the Disney Channel Original Movie Camp Rock, where they played a band called "Connect 3". Kevin played Jason, a guitarist; Nick played Nate, also a guitarist; and Joe played the lead male role and lead singer, Shane Gray.[21] A soundtrack for the movie was released on June 17, 2008.

The name was inspired by their hit song When You Look Me in the Eyes. The series was renewed for a second season, which premiered March 21, 2010.[23] The second season followed the band on the European leg of their World Tour 2009. The Jonas Brothers' third studio album, A Little Bit Longer, was released in the United States on August 12, 2008 and peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200.[24]

On June 16, 2009, the brothers' fourth studio album, and third release under Hollywood Records, titled Lines, Vines, and Trying Times was released. The album peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200 with 247,000 copies sold.[18]

On October 29, 2013, The Jonas Brothers officially announced that the band was breaking up because of creative differences.[30]
