Curry was a co-host on the television game show Ballbreakers. In 2006, she appeared on Gameshow Marathon as a celebrity panelist on the Match Game episode. She starred in "Rock Me Baby" (2004) and Half & Half (2003) on UPN. Curry also appeared on Dirt starring Courteney Cox,[3] with whom she shared scenes. She appeared in rock band's The Click Five music video "Just the Girl", along with husband Christopher Knight.

She has also starred in the films Fallen Angels, Light Years Away and "Jack Rio."[3]
In early 2005, Curry appeared on VH1's fourth season of The Surreal Life. After the season ended, Curry and fellow house guest Knight began dating, and later moved in together. On September 11, 2005, VH1 began airing My Fair Brady, a show that documented their life together[3] and paid her an estimated US$450,000. The show led her to being featured in Maxim's Hot 100, a list of the "hottest" women on earth[5] and ranked #100 on the Maxim Hot 100 Women of 2005.[6]
Season 3 of My Fair Brady began airing on January 21, 2008 and focused on Curry's breast enhancement surgery and Knight's competing (and contrary) desire to start a family.[3] In June 2008, Curry and her family and friends appeared on NBC's Celebrity Family Feud. Between November and December 2010, Curry worked as the "Resident Celebrity Gamer" panelist judge on the second series of The Tester, a reality program on the PlayStation Network. She has returned to the panel in the third series which began on February 7, 2012. Curry hosted live coverage of Blizzcon for Direct TV in 2011, as well as Hosting live from E3 for Namco Bandai in both 2011 and 2012. Most recently, Curry had teamed up with comic book legend Stan Lee to create her show "Superfans" for his new YouTube channel, Stan Lee's World of Heroes. "Superfans" began airing each week on YouTube in October 2012.
Christopher Knight proposed to Curry on the season finale of My Fair Brady, on VH1, which aired on November 6, 2005. The show was renewed for a second season that began in June 2006, and focused on the couple's wedding preparations. The couple wed in Curry's hometown of Joliet, Illinois on May 29, 2006, in a gothic-style wedding. Says Curry of the goth-themed ceremony, "I wanted to go as Gothic as I could and as traditional as I could without ruffling anyone's feathers. ... I wanted to have a black dress ... but I knew it would break my grandmother's heart."[7] In 2007, Curry and Knight appeared on the Dr. Phil Show to discuss their marital issues on an episode dealing with large age gaps in relationships. Dr. Phil predicted that their style of arguing, particularly Knight's hurtful comments, was a strong predictor of impending divorce in couples.[8] The couple announced their separation on May 29, 2011.[9] The couple filed for divorce on August 19, 2011 and it became final in 2013.[10]
At the 2014 San Diego Comic Con, when a friend was sexually assaulted, Curry (who was costumed as Catwoman) defended the victim by counter-attacking the assailant, hitting him with the hilt of her bullwhip. She quickly drove the attacker away.[11]
Curry announced her engagement to movie trailer-voice actor Matthew Rhode on August 5, 2017.[citation needed] Curry left Hollywood for good to pursue a normal "rural" life.[12] Curry now runs her own lifestyle blog from her remote location.[13] She and Rhode moved to Whitefish, Montana. They eloped in Glacier National Park in Montana on September 15, 2018.[14][15]
She is of Italian descent through her maternal grandmother.[16]
