The eMeta suite of software products, consisting of RightAccess and RightCommerce, helps customers like McGraw-Hill, NYTimes.com and Wolters Kluwer license and sell digital assets, including text, audio, video, streaming media, games and software applications (SaaS).
RightAccess is the access control module within the eMeta suite, providing advanced authentication, authorization, administration, registration and licensing functionality for all types of digital goods and services. RightAccess allows companies to manage how customers access online offerings.
RightCommerce is the ecommerce module within the eMeta suite, making it easy to market and sell digital products. Designed for complex digital goods billing and subscription management, it allows companies to target customers with free trials, discounts or gift subscriptions â€“ while increasing incremental or add-on purchases with promotions and targeted pricing.
