MediaTek Inc. (Chinese: 聯發科技; pinyin: Liánfākē Jì) is a Taiwanese fabless semiconductor company that provides chips for wireless communications, High-definition television, handheld mobile devices like smartphones and tablet computers, navigation systems, consumer multimedia products and Digital subscriber line services as well as optical disc drives.[5]
Headquartered in Hsinchu, Taiwan, the company has 25 offices worldwide and was the third largest fabless IC designer worldwide in 2016.[6][7] Mediatek was founded in 1997.[8][9] MediaTek also provides its customers with reference designs.[10]
MediaTek was originally a unit of United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) tasked with designing chipsets for home entertainment products.[8] On 28 May 1997, the unit was spun off and incorporated. MediaTek Inc. was listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSEC) under the "2454" code on 23 July 2001.[11]
The company started out designing chipsets for optical drives and subsequently expanded into chips for DVD players, digital TVs, mobile phones, smartphones and tablets.[8][10][12] In general MediaTek has had a strong record of gaining market share and displacing competitors after entering new markets.[10][13][14]
The company launched a division to design products for mobile devices in 2004. Seven years later, it was taking orders for more than 500 million mobile system-on-chip units per annum, which included products for both feature phones and smart devices.[8] By providing extensive system engineering assistance the company allowed many smaller companies and new entrants to enter a mobile phone market that had previously been dominated by large, often vertically integrated corporations that had long been broadly entrenched in the telecommunications industry. The mobile chip market quickly became the main growth driver for the company.[8][10][13][14]
At Mobile World Congress 2014, MediaTek unveiled its new brand “Everyday Genius”, dubbing the term “Super-mid market”, with the vision and aiming to make smartphones more accessible affordable to the wider market.[15]
As of November 2014, over 1500 mobile models accounting for 700 million units were shipped globally in 2014, using MediaTek chips, and the company posted revenues of US$5.3 billion in the first half of 2014, nearly as much as the whole of 2013.[16] The revenue growth was however partly due to revenue recognition from the acquisition of MStar which became effective at the beginning of 2014.[17]
On November 25, 2019, MediaTek and Intel announced a partnership to bring 5G to PCs in 2021.[18][19]
In 2005, MediaTek acquired Inprocomm, a wireless semiconductor design company producing 802.11a, b and a/g chips.[20]
On September 10, 2007 MediaTek announced its intention to buy Analog Devices cellular radio and baseband chipset divisions for US$350 million.[21] The acquisition was finalised by January 11, 2008.[22]
On 5 May 2011, MediaTek acquired Ralink Technology Corporation,[23] gaining products and expertise for Wi-Fi technology for mobile and non-mobile applications, as well as for wired DSL and Ethernet connectivity.
On 11 April 2012, MediaTek acquired Coresonic, a global producer of digital signal processing products based in Linköping, Sweden. Coresonic became a wholly owned subsidiary of MediaTek in Europe.[24]
On 22 June 2012, MediaTek announced it would acquire rival Taiwanese chipset designer MStar Semiconductor Inc., which held a strong market share position in digital television chips. The initial phase of the deal saw MediaTek taking a 48 percent stake, with an option to purchase the remaining stake at a later date.[25] The following merger between MediaTek and MStar was delayed by antitrust concerns in China and South Korea and finalized on 1 February 2014.[26]
MediaTek's financial results have been subject to variation as the financial success of different product lines fluctuated. MediaTek's relatively strong sales in 2009/2010 was based on its strong market position for feature phone chipsets. Smartphone and tablet products contributed to MediaTek's sales and income increase in 2013,[28] while revenue recognition from the acquisition of MStar Semiconductor, which became effective in February 2014, as well as a continuing strong position for smartphone and tablet solutions, were the main reasons for the sales growth seen in 2014.[29] In 2014 smartphone chips accounted for approximately 50–55% of revenue, followed by digital home products (25–30%, includes digital television chips), tablet chips (5–10%), feature phone chips (5–10%) and Wi-Fi products (5–10%).[30]
MediaTek started shipping chips with integrated 4G LTE baseband in volume in the second half of 2014, later than its largest competitor Qualcomm.[31] The additional cost of the separate baseband chip required in every 4G handset made MediaTek's offerings more expensive and prompted some of its larger customers, like Alcatel One Touch and ZTE, to choose competing SoCs like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 and 410 platforms, negatively affecting MediaTek's revenue stream.[32]
MediaTek's stock has been trading on the Taiwan Stock Exchange under the symbol TWSE: 2454.
MediaTek has often followed an "industry-first" strategy to differentiate itself from the competition.
The MT8135 system-on-chip (SoC) for tablets announced in July, 2013 was the industry's first chip to implement the new ARM big.LITTLE technology for heterogeneous multi-processing.[33][34] A variant of the MT8135 was used by Amazon in its Kindle Fire HD tablet models.[35] Also on November 20, 2013, MediaTek launched the MT6592 SoC, the first system-on-chip (SoC) with eight CPU cores which could be used simultaneously,[36] in contrast to competing SoCs with eight physical cores of which only a subset could be active at any given time. The "True Octa-Core" trademark was registered to emphasize the difference in marketing materials.
On 7 January 2014, MediaTek announced the development of the world's first "multimode receiver" for wireless charging. In contrast to existing implementations it is compatible with both inductive and resonant charging.[37] The resulting MT3188 wireless charging chip, certified by both the Power Matters Alliance and the Wireless Power Consortium was announced on February 24, 2014.[38]
On 25 February 2014, MediaTek announced the industry's first "five-in-one" wireless chip. The SoC MT6630 supports 802.11a/b/g/n/ac WiFi, Bluetooth, ANT+, GPS and FM radio.[39][40]
MediaTek collaborated with Google on the first Ultra HD TV platform for Android TV, resulting in the development of the MT5595 digital television SoC.[41] The product first shipped in LCD TV models made by Sony.[42]
On November 26, 2019, MediaTek announced the Dimensity 1000, the world's first mobile SoC supporting AV1.[43]

At the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2015, MediaTek announced the MT2601 for wearable devices based on Google's Android Wear software. According to MediaTek, with its small size it allows fewer components and lower current consumption when compared with other chipsets in the market. The chip includes a dual-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU, an ARM Mali-400 MP GPU, and allows display resolutions up to qHD (960x540). It can be combined with the MT6630 chip for wireless connectivity.[100]
The MediaTek MT2621[103] and MT2625[104] are two SoC's with build in LTE NB-IoT modems. The MT2625 was launched on 29 June 2017,[105] while the MT2621 was added on 24 November.[106][107]
MT6630 (2014) is a five-in-one combo wireless SoC integrating dual-band 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, advanced Wi-Fi Direct and Miracast support, Bluetooth 4.1, ANT+, tri-band GPS and FM transceiver. It is intended to be paired with chips like the MT6595 octa-core smartphone processor which features an integrated 4G modem but no built-in Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/GPS/FM functionality. It could also be used in tablets in conjunction with a stand-alone application processor.[40]
