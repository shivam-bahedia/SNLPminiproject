Lovato's parents divorced in mid-1994, shortly after her second birthday.[15] Lovato's father was of Mexican descent, with mostly Spanish and Native American ancestors, and came from a family that has been living in New Mexico for generations; he also had distant Portuguese and Jewish ancestry.[16][17] Her mother is of English and Irish ancestry.[18][19] Through her father, Lovato is a descendant of Civil War Union veteran Francisco Perea and Santa Fe de Nuevo México governor Francisco Xavier Chávez.[20] Lovato claims that through DNA testing she discovered that she is also of 16 percent Scandinavian descent and one percent of African descent.[21]
Lovato was raised in Dallas, Texas.[22][23] She began playing piano at age seven and guitar at ten,[24] when she also began dancing and acting classes.[25] In 2002, she began her career on the children's television series Barney & Friends, portraying the role of Angela.[26] Lovato told Ellen DeGeneres that due to her acting career she was bullied so harshly that she asked for homeschooling,[27] and received her high-school diploma through homeschooling in May 2009, one year early.[28] In 2006, Lovato appeared on Prison Break, and on Just Jordan the following year.[9]

Lovato's debut studio album, Don't Forget, was released on September 23, 2008, and was met with generally positive reviews from critics.[40][41][42] Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly said, "Demi Lovato might satisfy her 'tween fans but she won't be winning any rockers over with Don't Forget".[43] The album debuted at number two in the US, with first-week sales of 89,000 copies.[44] Ten of its songs were co-written with the Jonas Brothers.[45]
Don't Forget was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for US sales of over 500,000 copies.[46] Its lead single, "Get Back", was praised for its pop rock style and peaked at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100, also selling over 560,000 copies in the United States.[47][48][49] The album's second single, "La La Land", was cited for its strong rock elements[50] and peaked at number 52 in the US,[49] and cracked the top 40 in Ireland and the United Kingdom.[51][52] The music video for the song was directed by Brendan Malloy and Tim Wheeler.[53][full citation needed] The third single and title track, "Don't Forget", peaked at number 41 in the US.[54]

Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam, with Lovato reprising her role as Mitchie Torres, premiered on September 3, 2010.[77][78] Critics were ambivalent about the film's plot, and it has a 40-percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.[79] However, Lovato's performance was called "dependably appealing" by Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly.[80] The film premiered to eight million viewers, the number-one cable television movie of the year by the number of viewers.[81] Its accompanying soundtrack was released on August 10 with Lovato singing nine songs, including "Can't Back Down" and "Wouldn't Change a Thing".[82] The soundtrack debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 41,000 copies.[83] The Jonas Brothers: Live in Concert was reworked to incorporate Lovato and the rest of the film's cast;[84] it began on August 7, two weeks later than planned.[85] The Sonny with a Chance soundtrack was released on October 5; Lovato sang on four tracks, including "Me, Myself and Time".[86] It debuted (and peaked) at number 163 on the Billboard 200, her lowest-selling soundtrack.[87] That month, Lovato also announced her departure from Sonny with a Chance, putting her acting career on hiatus and ending the series;[88] she later said that she would return to acting when she felt confident doing so.[89] Her departure led to the spin-off series So Random! with the Sonny cast, featuring sketches from the former show-within-a-show.

Lovato released her third studio album, Unbroken, on September 20, 2011.[91] Begun in July 2010, the album experimented with R&B and featured less pop rock than her first two albums.[92] Lyrically, Unbroken encompasses more mature themes as opposed to Lovato's previous work, with some songs focusing on Lovato's personal struggles.[93] The album and its stylistic change received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Lovato's vocals and saw a growth in her musicianship due to the songs focusing on her struggles, but criticized the album's "party songs" and found the music to be more generic than her previous efforts.[94] Unbroken debuted at number four in the US, selling 97,000 copies in its first week of release; it was later certified Gold.[95]

Upon working with Lovato on her third studio album, Unbroken, Ryan Tedder stated, "Demi blew me out of the water vocally! I had no idea how good her voice is.

Get over your fear of being judged by your Facebook friends and Spotify her discography, because you're going to have the last laugh five years down the road (probably sooner) when she wins a Grammy. At 22 years old, her vocal range is astounding." She went on to further describe her vocals as "spectacular."[216]
On her 18th birthday, Lovato bought a Mediterranean-style house in Los Angeles, California; however, she decided to live in a "sober house" in Los Angeles after leaving rehab in January 2011.[217]

I still need space and time to heal."[253]
Lovato is an active supporter of LGBT rights. When the Defense of Marriage Act was struck down in June 2013, she tweeted: "Gay, straight, lesbian, bi. ... No one is better than any one else. What an incredible day for California AND for equality."[254] Lovato later said: "I believe in gay marriage, I believe in equality. I think there's a lot of hypocrisy with religion. But I just found that you can have your own relationship with God, and I still have a lot of faith."[255]
On December 23, 2011, Lovato posted a message on Twitter criticizing her former network for airing episodes of Shake It Up and So Random! in which characters joked about eating disorders.

In May 2014, Lovato was named the LA Pride Parade Grand Marshal and the lead performer for NYC Pride Week for her contribution to the LGBT community. NYC Pride spokesperson Patti Diluigi said, "Demi Lovato is an amazing role model for today's youth, both LGBT and non-LGBT, for her activism in the area of equality, positive messaging on body image, and level of openness with her struggles. As a community, we're fortunate to have an ally like Demi."[273] Lovato has also become the face of Human Rights Campaign's America's for Marriage Equality. For the announcement of the campaign, Lovato stated "Whether you're LGBT or straight, your love is valid, beautiful and an incredible love.
