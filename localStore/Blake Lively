Blake Lively was born as Blake Ellender Brown on August 25, 1987 in the Tarzana neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.[5] Her mother, Elaine (née McAlpin), worked as a talent scout, and her father, Ernie Lively (né Ernest Wilson Brown, Jr.), is an actor.[6][7] Lively was named after her grandmother's brother.[8][9] She is of English, Irish, and German descent.
She has an older brother, Eric Lively, two half-sisters, Lori Lively and Robyn Lively, and a half-brother, Jason Lively. Her half-siblings are from her mother's previous marriage. Both of her parents and all of her siblings are, or have been, in the entertainment industry.[10][11]
During her childhood, her parents took her to acting classes that they taught because they did not want to leave her with a babysitter. Lively said that watching her parents teach acting helped her learn the "drills" and gain confidence as she got older and entered the entertainment industry.[11][12] She began her acting career at age 10, when she appeared in the 1998 film Sandman, which was directed by Lively's father. She describes her role as a "bit part".[13] She was initially not particularly interested in acting and wanted to attend Stanford University.[8]
She attended Burbank High School, where she was a class president, a cheerleader and a member of the championship choir.[14] Her brother Eric asked his talent agent to send her on a few auditions over a period of a few months during the summer.[7] From these auditions, she was cast as Bridget for The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005) and filmed her scenes in between her junior and senior years.[15]
She appeared in the film adaptation of the novel of the same name, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, in 2005, as Bridget, one of the four female leads. Lively's performance in the film earned her a nomination for a Teen Choice Award for "Choice Movie Breakout – Female.[16] In 2006, Lively co-starred with Justin Long in Accepted, and Lively had minor roles in the horror film, Simon Says. While Accepted was not well received by critics, Lively's performance was, earning her a 'Breakthrough Award' from Hollywood Life.[17] In 2007, she played one of the two title characters in Elvis and Anabelle as Anabelle, a bulimic girl who hoped to win a beauty pageant. Lively said of getting into character for the role that she had 'shed serious weight' for her height. Lively stated that that process was difficult for her because food is "the No. 1 love of my life."[18] MovieLine.com praised her performance in the film and credited it as having been her "breakthrough role".[19]
Lively was cast in The CW's series Gossip Girl, based on the novel series of the same name by Cecily von Ziegesar, which premiered in September 2007. Already having deferred college for a year, Lively intended to turn the role down and become a student, but was told that she could attend college part-time while filming the show (she later said "This is advice to anyone: when they say, 'We promise, but we can't put it in writing,' there's a reason they can't put it in writing").[20] She played the role of Serena van der Woodsen in the teen drama until 2012 when the show ended.[21][22] Her first magazine cover was the November 2007 issue of Cosmo Girl, where she discussed her time in high school and her career prior to Gossip Girl.[23]
In 2008, Lively reprised her role as Bridget in the sequel The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2. Similarly to the first film, Lively's performance was positively received by critics.[24][25] As of November 2008, the film had earned over $44 million at the box office.[26] In 2009, she appeared as Gabrielle DiMarco in the romantic comedy New York, I Love You, a sequel to the 2006 film Paris, je t'aime.

Lively replaced Jennifer Lawrence as Ophelia, after the latter dropped out to do The Hunger Games.
