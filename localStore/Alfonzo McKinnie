Alfonzo McKinnie (born September 17, 1992) is an American professional basketball player for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for Eastern Illinois University and University of Wisconsin–Green Bay.
McKinnie played his first two years of high school basketball at Chicago's Curie Metropolitan High School. He played his final high school season as a starter at Marshall Metropolitan High School, during which he earned All-Red West Conference honors averaging 11.2 points and 8.5 rebounds per game.[1]
McKinnie was not a big scorer and lightly recruited during his one year at Marshall HS. He got a chance to play at Eastern Illinois. As sophomore he averaged 10.2 points and 7.0 rebounds per game.[2] After his second year, he transferred to Wisconsin-Green Bay, where he tore his meniscus at the end of his redshirt season. Later, he tore his meniscus again and had it removed.[3] He finished his college career averaging 7.1 points and 5.1 rebounds in 96 games.[2]
After going undrafted in the 2015 NBA Draft, McKinnie started his career with the East Side Pirates[4] in Luxembourg's semi-professional second division, where he became the go-to scorer, averaging 26 points per game.[5]
On May 21, 2016, he signed with the Mexican team Rayos de Hermosillo.[6] An old friend, former North Dakota forward Emmanuel Little suggested he join the CIBACOPA. McKinnie became a strong player on the squad. He helped lead the Rayos to the regular-season title and the final series before falling four games to two against the Nauticos de Mazatlan.[7]
In September 2016, McKinnie paid 175 dollars for a tryout with the Windy City Bulls of the NBA G League.[5] On October 30, 2016, he made Bulls’ G-League roster.[8] He played well for the Bulls in 2016.[9]
On July 9, 2017, McKinnie signed with the Toronto Raptors.[10] He made his NBA debut on October 19, 2017, playing in a single minute in their 117–100 win over the Chicago Bulls. During his rookie season, he received multiple assignments to Raptors 905, Toronto's NBA G League affiliate.[11] On July 17, 2018, the Raptors waived McKinnie.[12]
McKinnie signed with the Golden State Warriors for the 2018–19 season. He ultimately earned a spot on the team’s opening night roster.[13] He recorded his career first double-double (19 points, 10 rebounds, both career high) in 27 minutes off the bench on October 29 against the Chicago Bulls.[14] McKinnie went to average 4.7 points a game for the season while playing 72 games. The Warriors went on to advance to the 2019 NBA Finals where they lost to the Toronto Raptors in 6 games. On October 18, 2019, the Warriors waived McKinnie.[15]
On October 21, 2019, the Cleveland Cavaliers claimed McKinnie off waivers.[16] On January 6, 2020, he was waived by the Cavaliers.[17] On January 9, they resigned him on a 10-day contract.[18]

He is the son of Elisa Bryant and Alfonzo McKinnie, Sr.[1] In 2018, during his first stop in Chicago with the Warriors, he signed papers to buy his mother a house, and introduced his parents at the Warriors team dinner after he helped Golden State blow out the Bulls.
