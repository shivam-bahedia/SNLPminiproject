In the 1990s, she received three Emmy nominations as Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her roles on the television series ER and The X-Files.
Cartwright was born in Bristol and grew up in Los Angeles, having immigrated to the US shortly after the birth of her younger sister, actress Angela Cartwright.
