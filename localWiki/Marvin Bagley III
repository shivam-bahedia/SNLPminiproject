Marvin Bagley III (born March 14, 1999) is an American professional basketball player for the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils and was a 2018 Consensus All-American. He was selected with the second overall pick by the Kings in the 2018 NBA draft. On May 21, he was selected to the 2018–19 NBA All-Rookie First Team.
Bagley attended Corona del Sol High School in Tempe, Arizona as a freshman and Hillcrest Prep in Phoenix, Arizona as a sophomore.[1] During that sophomore year, he was teammates with future #1 pick Deandre Ayton. In 2016, he transferred to Sierra Canyon School in Chatsworth, California.[2][3] He was ruled ineligible to play his first year at Sierra Canyon due to California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) rules.[4][5] That ruling would help play a factor into reclassifying his senior year of high school up a year early. In his last season for Sierra Canyon, he averaged 24.9 points per game and 10.1 rebounds per game. He would be named for the All-USA Today First-team in 2017.
Bagley was rated as a five-star recruit throughout his high school career and was formerly ranked as the top player in the 2018 class before his reclassification.[6][7][8][9] His first college basketball scholarship came from Northern Arizona University when he was 14.[10]
Before beginning what would have been his senior year of high school, Bagley reclassified into the Class of 2017. On August 14, 2017, he announced that he successfully reclassified as a graduate from Sierra Canyon and was eligible to play college basketball for Duke University during the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.[11] thus allowing him to enter the 2018 NBA draft as an early entry in the collegiate level.[12][13][14] He graduated from Sierra Canyon on September 1, 2017 and went to Duke after finishing high school academics a week later.[15][16]
Bagley made his Duke debut on November 10, 2017, recording 25 points and 10 rebounds in a win over Elon University. On November 24, Bagley scored 34 points and made a freshman record 15 rebounds for Duke as they defeated the Texas Longhorns 85–78 in overtime. He tied the freshman record for rebounds in the next game 4 days later and scored 30 points in an 87–84 win over the Florida Gators. It was the first time a Duke player did so since the 1960s. On December 30, Bagley recorded 32 points and a record 21 rebounds in a 100–93 win over the Florida State Seminoles. With 30 points and 11 rebounds in an 89–71 win over the Wake Forest Demon Deacons on January 13, 2018, he became the ACC's record holder for most 30 point, 10 rebound double-doubles in a season.[17] At the end of the regular season, Bagley was named both the ACC's Rookie of the Year and Player of the Year, as well as a member of the All-ACC first team.[18] He was also named a consensus member of the All-American First-Team by multiple organizations. In addition to that, Bagley joined Deandre Ayton and Trae Young as the most freshmen players to join the consensus All-American First-Team in a season.
Following Duke's loss in the 2018 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, Bagley announced his intention to forgo his final three seasons of collegiate eligibility and declare for the 2018 NBA draft.[19]
On June 21, 2018, Bagley was selected second overall in the 2018 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings, behind his former high school teammate Deandre Ayton.[20] On July 1, 2018, he signed a rookie scale contract with the Kings.[21]
Bagley made his professional debut with Sacramento on October 17, 2018, with 6 points and 5 rebounds in only 12 minutes coming off the bench in a 123–117 loss to the Utah Jazz.[22] In his next game two days later, Bagley recorded 19 points, 8 rebounds, 3 assists, and 3 blocks in a 149–129 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans.[23] On November 24, Bagley had a double-double of 20 points and 17 rebounds coming off the bench in a 117–116 loss to the Golden State Warriors.[24] During their second match against Golden State on December 14, he sprained his left knee,[25][26] which sidelined him for 11 games.[27] On March 19, 2019, Bagley made a career-high 28 points off the bench in a 123–121 loss to the Brooklyn Nets, in which the Kings entered the fourth quarter with a 25-point lead.
On October 24, 2019, Bagley was diagnosed to have a non-displaced fracture in his right thumb and was expected to be sidelined for about four to six weeks.[28]
Bagley has two younger brothers: Marcus (currently a high school senior) and 8-year-old Martay.[29] His father, Marvin Jr., previously played college football at North Carolina A&T, as well as with the Arizona Rattlers professionally. His father met his wife, Tracy Caldwell, while Marvin Jr. was playing with the Rattlers in the Arena Football League. Marvin Jr. currently coaches AAU basketball for the Nike Phamily.[30] Bagley's younger brother, Marcus Bagley, has received offers from Arizona, Arizona State, and UCLA.[31] Marcus would commit to Arizona State. While living in the Los Angeles area, Bagley volunteered at Hoops with Heart, a non-profit organization in the city that benefits underprivileged youth.[32] He is also the grandson of former Olympic and professional basketball player Jumpin' Joe Caldwell, who was the number two overall pick in the 1964 NBA draft.[33]
Other than basketball, Marvin Bagley III is a rapper and hip-hop artist. He is known for writing his own raps in his free time and creating a variety of music.[34] His songs range from those that tell his story to those that are made to relate to. His album "Big Jreams" was released on August 24, 2019. His album features artists such as Iman Shumpert and Famous Los.[35]
