Lina Romay (born Rosa María Almirall Martínez; 25 June 1954 – 15 February 2012) was a Spanish actress (born in Barcelona) who often appeared in films directed by her long-time companion (and later husband) Jesús Franco.
Romay was born in Barcelona in 1954. Following graduation from high school, she studied the arts, married actor/photographer Ramon Ardid (they later divorced), and began acting in stage productions. She began appearing in Jesús Franco's films from the time that they met in 1972. She appeared in more than a hundred feature films, most of them directed by Franco. The majority of their films together were in the adult film genre, but she also featured in many horror, comedy and action/adventure films as well. Among the better known of her horror films are The Bare Breasted Countess (a.k.a. Female Vampire) (1973/1975), Barbed Wire Dolls (1975) and Jack the Ripper (1976).[1]
She took the name Lina Romay from the actress and jazz artist from the 1940s.[2] Although Romay was listed in the credits of several of Franco's films as a co-director, actor Antonio Mayans stated in a recent interview that Franco used to credit her in that manner for business reasons, although she never actually co-directed any of their films together.
Lina Romay and Jesús Franco were a couple for four decades, but only officially married on April 25, 2008.[3] She died from cancer at the age of 57 on 15 February 2012, in Málaga, Spain. Franco died in 2013.
