Bryan Guy Adams was born on 5 November 1959 in Kingston, Ontario, Canada,[12] to parents from the United Kingdom: Elizabeth Jane (née Watson) and Captain Conrad J. Adams, who emigrated to Canada from Plymouth, England in the 1950s.[13] Adams' father, a Sandhurst officer in the British Army, joined the Canadian Army and later spent time as a United Nations peacekeeping observer for Canada, which led to him becoming a Canadian foreign service diplomat.[13] Adams travelled with his parents to diplomatic postings in Lisbon, Portugal (where he attended the American School of Lisbon)[14] and Vienna, Austria, during the 1960s, and to Tel Aviv, Israel during the early 1970s.[15][16]
Raised in Ottawa, Adams attended Colonel By Secondary School in the Beacon Hill neighbourhood of East Ottawa.[17] In 1974, Adams, his mother, and younger brother Bruce moved to North Vancouver while his father was posted abroad.[18][19]
Adams started working in the Vancouver music scene with bands and as a studio session singer, which paid the rent. At the age of 15, he became the vocalist for a pub band Sweeney Todd. An earlier incarnation of the band had a number one hit on the Canadian charts with a song called "Roxy Roller". Adams recorded a re-make of the song for the US which came in at No. 99 on the US charts. This new incarnation of the band also released an album If Wishes Were Horses (1977) with Adams billed as "Bryan Guy Adams" on vocals. Adams left the band at age 16.[citation needed] In 1978, at age 18, Adams met Jim Vallance through a mutual friend in a Vancouver music store. Vallance was the former drummer and principal songwriter for Vancouver-based rock band Prism, and had recently quit that band to focus on a career as a studio musician and songwriter. They agreed to meet at Vallance's home studio a few days later. This proved to be the beginning of a partnership which, as of 2017[update], is still in existence.[20][21]
Later in 1978, Adams signed to A&M records for one dollar.[22] A&M remixed one of Adams' demos as a disco song "Let Me Take You Dancing", featuring Adams' vocals sped up to meet the 122BPM dance tempo. The song made the Canadian RPM chart in March 1979 along with its B-Side, "Don't Turn Me Away".[23]
Adams's self-titled debut album, mostly co-written with Jim Vallance, was released in February 1980. With the exception of "Remember" and "Wastin' Time", most of the album was recorded in October and November 1979 at Manta Studios and co-produced by Adams and Vallance.[citation needed] The album was certified gold in Canada in 1986.[24]

"Heaven" had reached number nine on the mainstream rock chart the previous year when it was released as a non-album track.[25] "Run To You" was the most successful single at album-oriented rock stations, as it spent four weeks at the top of the mainstream rock chart; "Somebody" reached number one for a single week on that chart. "It's Only Love" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group. In 1986, the song won an MTV award for Best Stage Performance.
