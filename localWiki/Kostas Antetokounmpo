Kostas Ndubuisi Antetokounmpo (Greek: Κώστας Αντετοκούνμπο) (born November 20, 1997)[1] is a Greek professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), on a two-way contract with the South Bay Lakers of the NBA G League. He was drafted 60th overall by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 2018 NBA draft, and his draft rights were then traded to the Dallas Mavericks.[2] He attended and played collegiate level basketball in the United States for the Dayton Flyers. He is listed as a 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) power forward. Two of his older brothers, Giannis and Thanasis, both play for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA)
Antetokounmpo was born in Sepolia in Athens, Greece. As a youth, he began playing the sport of basketball with the junior youth teams of Filathlitikos, in Athens.
After his older brother Giannis was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2013 NBA draft, Antetokounmpo, along with his parents and his younger brother, Alexis, moved to Milwaukee. He attended Dominican High School in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin,[3] where he played high school basketball during his junior and senior years. As a senior, he led his team to a state championship.[4]
After high school, Antetokounmpo moved on to play college basketball at the University of Dayton. In the 2016–17 season, his first with the Flyers, he was red-shirted,[5] after being ruled a "partial qualifier",[6] due to having spent his first two years of high school in Greece.[7] He debuted in the 2017–18 season,[8] averaging 5.2 points, 2.9 rebounds, 0.4 assists, 0.2 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game, in 15.1 minutes per game.[9]
On March 22, 2018, Antetokounmpo declared for the 2018 NBA draft.[10] On May 4, 2018, Antetokounmpo would be one of a record-high 69 players to enter the NBA Draft Combine.[11] Antetokounmpo was projected to be a second round selection, similar to his older brother Thanasis, due to his lack of notable progress in his redshirt freshman college season. He would ultimately wind up being the last pick of the 2018 NBA draft, after being selected by the Philadelphia 76ers, only to then be immediately traded to the Dallas Mavericks.[12][13] Antetokounmpo would later sign a two-way contract on July 13. Throughout the contract, he will split his playing time between the Mavericks and their NBA G League affiliate, the Texas Legends.[14] He made his NBA debut on March 20, 2019 in a 118–126 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers.[15]
On July 19, 2019, Antetokounmpo was waived by the Mavericks.[16] He would later be claimed by the Los Angeles Lakers on July 22, 2019.[17][18]
Antetokounmpo played with the junior Greek Under-20 national team. He played at the 2016 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship Division B, where he won a bronze medal.[19] During the tournament, he averaged 1.3 points, 1.8 rebounds, and 0.3 assists per game.[20]
Antetokounmpo was born in Athens, Greece, to Nigerian parents. He officially became a full Greek citizen in 2016.[21] In addition, along with his younger sibling, Alexis, he has a Nigerian passport, which was granted to him in June 2013, so that he could gain a visa, and be allowed to legally enter into the United States.[22]
His late father, Charles, was a former Nigerian soccer player, while his mother, Veronica, was a high jumper.[23] Charles died in September 2017, at age 54.[24] His parents are from different Nigerian ethnic groups—Charles was Yoruba, and Veronica is Igbo.[25] His oldest brother, Francis, is also a professional soccer player. He is a younger brother of Milwaukee Bucks players Giannis and Thanasis. He is also the older brother of Alexis.[26] As a youth, Antetokounmpo was developed by the junior clubs of Filathlitikos, which also developed his older brothers Thanasis and Giannis.
