Spiceworks is a professional network for the information technology (IT) industry that is headquartered in Austin, Texas.[1][2][3] The company was founded in January 2006 by Scott Abel, Jay Hallberg, Greg Kattawar, and Francis Sullivan to build IT management software.[2][4]
Spiceworks is an online community where users can collaborate and seek advice from one another, and also engage in a marketplace to purchase IT-related services and products.[5] The network is estimated to be used by more than six million IT professionals and 3,000 technology vendors.[6]
The company's free proprietary software is written in Ruby on Rails,[7] and runs exclusively on Microsoft Windows.[8] The software discovers IP-addressable devices and includes help desk functionality and an integrated knowledge base.[9]
The company was formed in January 2006 by Scott Abel, Jay Hallberg, Greg Kattawar and Francis Sullivan,[3] former executives at Motive.[4][10][11]The group had originally gathered in 2005, envisioning a social methodology in which to do IT.
The company received $5 million in series A funding from Austin Ventures in June 2006.[12] Spiceworks' series B funding round was completed in August 2007 and included $8 million from Shasta Ventures and Austin Ventures.[13] The company's $18 million series C funding round in January 2010 was headed by Institutional Venture Partners.[14] In April 2011, Spiceworks received $25 million in series D funding from Adams Street Partners and Tenaya Capital[15] and a 2014 series E financing round worth $57 million led by Goldman Sachs.[5]
In July 2006, it released a public beta.[12] The 1.0 version of Spiceworks was released in November 2006.[16] It focussed on simplifying the process of taking inventory, monitoring networks, and generating reports for IT professionals at small and medium-sized businesses.[4][12] By the end of its first year, Spiceworks had 120,000 users.[17]
The company released the 2.0 version of its software in December 2007.[18] Subsequent versions followed, leading up to version 7.0 in 2013.[19] The company released a free network monitor product in December 2014.[20]
In 2012, it opened its European headquarters in London, England.[21]
The company celebrated its tenth anniversary in January 2016 and announced plans to add 100 additional employees during the year.[22] However, those plans were changed and in June 2016 the company announced that it was laying off approximately 12 percent of its workforce.[23] In addition to the layoffs, several employees in leadership positions at Spiceworks left the company to join former CEO Scott Abel in founding a new startup, Resly Labs.[24][25] Resly Labs later changed their name to Umuse.
Spiceworks offers its professional network and software free to users.[1][11][26] The company generates most of its revenue through the sale of ads displayed on its network.[1] A small percentage of its revenue is generated through purchases of IT products and services made through the Spiceworks platform.[5] The platform also includes premium features, which are available for purchase.[5]
The official mascot for Spicework is "SpiceRex."[27] SpiceRex is an orange Tyrannosaurus rex. The creation was a result of Spiceworks community member, IT pro, and blogger Andy "akp982" Phelps.[28]
Spiceworks has hosted SpiceWorld, a conference for its users, every year since 2008.[11][29] The conference was originally held at the Alamo Drafthouse movie theater.[29] The conference later moved to the AT&T Executive Education & Conference Center at the University of Texas. Starting with SpiceWorld 2013 and on, the conferences have been held at the Austin Convention Center.[29][30]
With a growing international community, Spiceworks opened up a London office in 2012. The first SpiceWorld London took place in May 2012 in Vinopolis in London's Bankside.[31]
