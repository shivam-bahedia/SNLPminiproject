Samuel Alexander Joseph West[2] (born 19 June 1966[3]) is an English actor, theatre director and voice actor. He has directed on stage and radio,[1] and worked as an actor across theatre, film, television and radio.[4] He often appears as reciter with orchestras and performed at the Last Night of the Proms in 2002.[5] He has narrated several documentary series, including five for the BBC centred on events related to the Second World War.
West was born in London, the elder son of actors Prunella Scales and Timothy West, and the grandson of the actor Lockwood West.[6][7] He has one brother. He was educated at Alleyn's School[8] and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where he studied English Literature[9][7] and was president of the Experimental Theatre Club.[10]
West made his London stage debut in February 1989 at the Orange Tree Theatre, playing Michael in Cocteau's Les Parents Terribles,[11] of which critic John Thaxter wrote: "He invests the role with a warmth and validity that silences sniggers that could so easily greet a lesser performance of this difficult role, and he lets us share the tumbling emotions of a juvenile torn between romantic first love and filial duty."[12] Since then, West has appeared frequently on stage; he played Valentine in the first ever production of Tom Stoppard's Arcadia at the National Theatre in 1993[13] and later spent two seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company playing the title roles in Richard II and Hamlet, both directed by Steven Pimlott.[14][15]
In 2002, West made his stage directorial debut with The Lady's Not for Burning at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester.[16] He succeeded Michael Grandage as artistic director of Sheffield Theatres from 2005–2007.[16][17] During his time as artistic director West revived the controversial The Romans in Britain[18] and also directed As You Like It as part of the RSC's Complete Works Festival.[19][20] West left Sheffield when the theatre closed for refurbishment in 2007 and made his West End directorial debut with the first major revival of Dealer's Choice following its transferral to the Trafalgar Studios.[21] He also continued his acting career: in 2007 he appeared alongside Toby Stephens and Dervla Kirwan in Betrayal at the Donmar Warehouse,[22]
In November 2008 he played Harry in the Donmar revival of T. S. Eliot's Family Reunion[23] and in 2009 he starred as Jeffrey Skilling in Enron by Lucy Prebble.[24] His 2008 production of Waste at the Almeida Theatre was chosen by The Times as one of its "Productions of the Decade".[25] From November 2012 to January 2013 he appeared as Astrov in a production of Uncle Vanya at the Vaudeville Theatre.[26] He played Ivanov and Trigorin in the Chichester Festival Theatre's Young Chekhov Season from September 2015, alongside Nina Sosanya, Anna Chancellor, and James McArdle.[27][28]
In 1991, West played the lower-middle-class clerk Leonard Bast in the Merchant Ivory film adaptation of E. M. Forster's novel Howards End (released 1992) opposite Emma Thompson, Helena Bonham Carter and Anthony Hopkins. For this role, he was nominated for best supporting actor at the 1993 BAFTA Film Awards.[29] Two years later he again appeared with Thompson in the film Carrington. His film career has continued with roles in a number of well known films, such as Franco Zeffirelli's Jane Eyre, Notting Hill, Iris and Van Helsing. In 2004, he appeared in the year's highest rated mini-series on German television, Die Nibelungen, which was released in the United States in 2006 as Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King. In 2012, he played King George VI in Hyde Park on Hudson.

He played Anthony Blunt in Cambridge Spies, a BBC production about the four British spies, starring alongside Toby Stephens (Philby), Tom Hollander (Burgess) and Rupert Penry-Jones (Maclean). He reprises his role as Blunt in "Olding" the premiere episode of the third season of The Crown released in 2019.[30]
In 2006, he took the lead role in a BBC production of Random Quest adapted from the short story by John Wyndham and the next year played Edward Heath in Margaret Thatcher – The Long Walk to Finchley, also for the BBC. In 2010 he played Peter Scabius in the televised adaptation of William Boyd's novel Any Human Heart, while in 2011 he starred as Zak Gist in the ITV series Eternal Law. In addition, he appeared in the BBC series As Time Goes By episode "We'll Always Have Paris" (1994) as the character Terry.
He plays Frank Edwards in the ITV drama Mr Selfridge, and Sir Walter Pole in the 2015 BBC adaptation of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell.
