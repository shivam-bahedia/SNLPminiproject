In college, Hill began writing his own plays and performing them in the Black and White bar in the East Village neighborhood of New York City.[27] His plays developed a small following and helped him realize that his true desire was to act in films. Hill was befriended by Dustin Hoffman's children, Rebecca and Jake, who introduced Hill to their father.[10] The elder Hoffman asked him to audition for a role in I Heart Huckabees, in which Hill made his film debut.[27][25]
Hill then made a brief appearance in Judd Apatow's directorial debut The 40-Year-Old Virgin,[28] which eventually led to his appearing in the role of a virgin video game tester in the comedy Grandma's Boy (2006) and featuring in the comedies Accepted and Click, playing Adam Sandler's character's son in the latter film.[29] Hill was featured in a larger supporting role in the Apatow-directed Knocked Up (2007).

His first leading role was in the Apatow-produced comedy Superbad.
