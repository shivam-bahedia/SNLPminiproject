Nenad Zimonjić (Serbian Cyrillic: Ненад Зимоњић, pronounced [nênaːd zǐmoɲitɕ];[3] born 4 June 1976) is a Serbian professional tennis player who was ranked World No. 1 in 2008 in doubles. He is the second tennis doubles player from Serbia to hold the World No. 1, after Slobodan Živojinović. While Zimonjić is known as a doubles specialist (winning 3 Grand Slams in men's doubles and 5 in mixed doubles), he has recorded two big wins in his singles career. A 22-year span consisting of 54 Davis Cup ties including 43 victories has resulted in him becoming the most accomplished Davis Cup player in his nations history. He has a very powerful first serve that he can hit at up to 235 km/h (146 mph).
Zimonjić turned pro in 1995 and remained relatively unknown outside his native country until a surprise victory in the mixed doubles at the 2004 Australian Open. Paired for the first time with Russian Elena Bovina, he beat defending champions Martina Navratilova and Leander Paes in straight sets in an hour and nine minutes. Alongside Katarina Srebotnik of Slovenia, he won the 2006 French Open crown with a straight-sets victory over Daniel Nestor and Elena Likhovtseva. At the 2006 Wimbledon Championships, Zimonjić reached the final of the men's doubles alongside France's Fabrice Santoro and the quarterfinals of the mixed doubles.
In 2007, Zimonjić reached the 2007 French Open mixed doubles final as the defending champions with Katarina Srebotnik and lost to Nathalie Dechy and Andy Ram. He left Santoro after Wimbledon and teamed with Mahesh Bhupathi until after the 2007 US Open. After the US Open, Nenad left Bhupathi and partnered with Daniel Nestor,[4] who won the French Open earlier in the year alongside Mark Knowles. The team won the 2007 St. Petersburg Open, without losing a set. Nestor and Zimonjić later won 2008 Wimbledon[5] (Zimonjić's first Grand Slam), 2009 Wimbledon and 2010 French Open.
In 2009, they defended their Wimbledon title & won 5 Masters 1000 titles. At the World Team Cup as a part of the Serbian team. With Victor Troicki, he won two decisive games against Italian and Argentinian teams; as a result, Serbia finished first in its group, and then proceeded to beat Germany in the final encounter.
In 2010, they finished runners-up at the Australian Open, later on in the year he won both the doubles with Daniel Nestor and the mixed doubles with Katarina Srebotnik at Roland Garros. Zimonjic ended his partnership with Nestor after winning the ATP World Tour Finals.
In 2011 he partnered with Michaël Llodra, together then won one Masters 1000 title & four ATP 500 titles. Their partnership ended in early 2012. In 2014, he & Nestor renewed their partnership which saw them both return to the top 10 by May & ranked 3 by the end of the year. In 2015 he teamed up with Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi. On 26 July 2017 the Serbian became the 10th player to record 700 doubles match wins (or more).[6]
In 2004, he defeated Andre Agassi in St Pölten, and in 2005 on the grass of Halle, he defeated Nicolas Kiefer. Other recognised opponents include Ivo Karlovic in 2000, Nicolas Mahut in 2001.
Zimonjić has been a member of Serbia Davis Cup team (previously Yugoslavia Davis Cup team and Serbia and Montenegro Davis Cup team, respectively) since 1995, playing both singles and doubles, and in 2003–2004 he was the playing captain of the national team. In recent years, with the emergence of highly ranked Serbian singles players Novak Djokovic, Janko Tipsarević, and Viktor Troicki, Zimonjić became a doubles specialist on the team, partnering all of them, as well as Dušan Vemić and Ilija Bozoljac.
In 2010, Serbia won its first ever Davis Cup title, following the victories over United States (3–2), Croatia (4–1), Czech Republic (3–2), and France in the final match (3–2). Zimonjić played in all four doubles rubbers over the course of the competition, winning once (against Croatia, partnering Tipsarević) and losing the other three times (partnering Tipsarević, Djokovic, and Troicki, respectively). To celebrate the win, all the players shaved their heads. The central celebration was held in Belgrade in front of several thousand fans, and the Serbian national postal service issued a stamp picturing the players.[7]
In the 2013 quarterfinals against the United States, he and Ilija Bozoljac had an impressive five set victory against the no. 1 ranked Bryan brothers.[8]
Zimonjić was born in Belgrade, and was brought up in the Borča suburb, while he is currently living in New Belgrade. Zimonjić's paternal family hails from the Gacko region in Herzegovina, from where it settled in Vučkovica near Kragujevac, while his mother was born in Gospić, in Lika.[9] The family's slava (feast day) is Aranđelovdan.[10] He is related to Bogdan Zimonjić (1813–1909), a Serbian Orthodox priest and guerilla leader.[9]
In 2008, he married former model Mina Knežević. On 4 December 2008 his wife gave birth to twins, Leon and Luna.[11][12]
