The Coldwater area was inhabited by Potawatomi Native Americans at the time of first contact with European trappers, traders, and colonists. The French, and later the British, had traded with the Potawatomi. The Potawatomi language referred to the area as, "The land of the cold, cold water." Control over the area passed from Great Britain to the United States in 1796, with the British withdrawal from Detroit.
American settlers did not move into the area until around 1830, with many arriving from New York and New England.[8] Coldwater was incorporated as a village in 1837, and then incorporated by the legislature as a city in 1861.[9] It was designated in 1842 as the county seat of Branch County.[8]
The Coldwater River flows into the city from the south, originating from Coldwater Lake. The Coldwater chain of lakes also has an outlet called the Sauk River, which flows from its north end (near Quincy) and then through the south side of the city of Coldwater. Both combine to form a series of shallow, connected lakes on the city's west side.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 8.27 square miles (21.42 km2), of which 8.03 square miles (20.80 km2) is land and 0.24 square miles (0.62 km2) is water.[10]
