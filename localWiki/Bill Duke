William Henry Duke, Jr. (born February 26, 1943) is an American actor, director, producer, and writer of film and television. Known for his physically imposing frame, Duke works primarily in the action and crime drama genres, but occasionally appears in comedy.[1] Frequently a character actor, he has starred opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in Commando and Predator, and has appeared in films like American Gigolo, No Man's Land, Bird on a Wire, Menace II Society, Exit Wounds, Payback, X-Men: The Last Stand and Mandy; he often plays characters related to law enforcement.
As a director, he has helmed episodes of numerous television series including Cagney & Lacey, Hill Street Blues, Miami Vice, The Twilight Zone, and American Playhouse, and the crime film Deep Cover and A Rage in Harlem, for which he was nominated for a Palme d'Or. He was director of the movie Sister Act 2 starring Whoopi Goldberg and Lauryn Hill. He directed episodes of several noteworthy 1980s television series, including Hill Street Blues and Miami Vice.[2]

As the action-film-oriented genre became more popular, Duke's presence was perfect to portray a string of "tough guy" roles.
