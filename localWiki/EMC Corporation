Dell EMC (until 2016, EMC Corporation) is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Hopkinton, Massachusetts and Round Rock, Texas, United States.[2] Dell EMC sells data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing and other products and services that enable organizations to store, manage, protect, and analyze data. Dell EMC's target markets include large companies and small- and medium-sized businesses across various vertical markets.[3][4] The company's stock (as EMC Corporation) was added to the New York Stock Exchange on April 6, 1986,[5] and was also listed on the S&P 500 index.
EMC was acquired by Dell in 2016; at that time, Forbes noted EMC's "focus on developing and selling data storage and data management hardware and software and convincing its customers to buy its products independent of their other IT buying decisions" based on "best-of-breed."[6] It was later renamed to Dell EMC.
Dell uses the EMC name with some of its products.[7]
EMC, founded in 1979 by Richard Egan, Roger Marino & John Curly (the E, M & C in EMC),[8] introduced its first 64-kilobyte (65,536 bytes) memory boards for the Prime Computer in 1981[9][10] and continued with the development of memory boards for other computer types. In the mid-1980s the company expanded beyond memory to other computer data storage types and networked storage platforms. EMC began shipping its flagship product, the Symmetrix, in 1990. Symmetrix was the main reason for EMC's rapid growth in the 1990s, both in size and value, from a company valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars to a multi-billion dollar company.[11]
Michael Ruettgers joined EMC in 1988 and served as CEO from 1992 until January 2001.[12] Under Ruettgers' leadership, EMC revenues grew from $120 million to nearly $9 billion 10 years later, and the company shifted its focus from memory boards to storage systems.[13] Ruettgers was named one of BusinessWeek's "World's Top 25 Executives"; one of the "Best Chief Executive Officers in America" by Worth magazine; and one of Network World's "25 Most Powerful People in Networking".[13]
Some of EMC's growth was via acquisitions of small companies.[14]
On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire EMC in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $67 billion, which has been considered the largest-ever acquisition in the technology sector. This would combine Dell's enterprise server, personal computer, and mobile businesses with EMC's enterprise storage business. Dell would pay $24.05 per share of EMC, and $9.05 per share of tracking stock in VMware.[15][16][17]
On September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. completed the merger with EMC Corp., which involved the issuance of $45.9 billion in debt and $4.4 billion common stock.[18][19]
In addition to those of the majority-owned Pivotal company, Dell EMC sells products and services, including products from other Dell Technologies companies, designed to allow IT departments to move to a cloud computing model and to analyze big data.

In 2012, EMC sponsored The Human Face of Big Data,[90] a globally crowd-sourced media project focusing on the ability to collect, analyze, triangulate and visualize vast amounts of data in real time. The Human Face of Big Data, produced by Rick Smolan and Jennifer Erwitt, includes "a number of fascinating stories ... [that] represent some of the most innovative applications of data that are shaping our future".[91]
