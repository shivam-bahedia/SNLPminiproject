Robert Prosky (born Robert Joseph Porzuczek, December 13, 1930 – December 8, 2008) was an American actor. He became a well-known supporting actor in the 1980s with his roles in Thief (1981), Christine (1983), The Natural (1984), and Broadcast News (1987). Prosky's other notable movies include Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990), Hoffa (1992), Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), Last Action Hero (1993), Miracle on 34th Street (1994), Dead Man Walking (1995), and Mad City (1997).
Prosky, a Polish American,[1] was born in the Manayunk neighborhood of Philadelphia,[2] Pennsylvania, to Helen (Kuhn) and Joseph Porzuczek.[3] His father was a grocer and butcher.[4][5][6] He was raised in a working-class neighborhood and studied at the American Theatre Wing, later graduating from Temple University. He performed at Old Academy Players, a small theater in the East Falls section of Philadelphia, adjacent to Manayunk.
Prosky appeared in Thief, Christine, Hanky Panky, The Natural, Hoffa, Broadcast News, Things Change, The Great Outdoors, Loose Cannons, Rudy, Mrs. Doubtfire, Green Card, and Dead Man Walking. In addition to appearing in films, Prosky appeared as a regular on Hill Street Blues, Danny, and Veronica's Closet. He was considered for the role of Martin Crane in Frasier and later made a guest appearance in the series as a reclusive writer. He was offered the role of Coach Ernie Pantusso on Cheers, but turned it down; he later portrayed Rebecca Howe's father on the same show.[7] Prosky also portrayed Jake "the Snake" Connolly on a two-part 1991 episode of Coach.
He also appeared as Will Darnell, the man who owned the auto repair shop where Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) rebuilds the possessed car "Christine" in the film John Carpenter's Christine based on Stephen King's novel.
In addition to his film and television career, he appeared in numerous productions at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., most notably as Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman. Prosky often performed at Arena Stage with over 100 stage credits to his name at that theatre alone. He played Shelly Levene in the 1984 Chicago and Broadway production of David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Glengarry Glen Ross. He was also a board member of the Cape May Stage in Cape May, New Jersey.
Prosky appeared in two films, Dead Man Walking and The Chamber, with actor Raymond J. Barry.
In 1960, he married Ida Hove, and had three sons, Stefan, John and Andrew Prosky. Andrew and John Prosky are also actors.[citation needed]
Prosky died on December 8, 2008, five days before his 78th birthday.[8] His son John said that the cause was complications of heart surgery at the Washington Hospital Center.[9] The New York Times described him: "a craggy-faced, heavyset character actor who, after 23 years in regional theater, became a familiar face on Broadway, in movies and on television, notably as a gruff desk sergeant in the later years of Hill Street Blues."[9]
Playbill described him: "He was best suited to playing salt-of-the-earth characters, sometimes with a mischievous or slightly sinister edge."[7]
At the time of his death, he was living in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington, D.C.[7]
