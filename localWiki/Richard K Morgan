Richard Kingsley Morgan, known as Richard K. Morgan in the U.S. (born 24 September 1965) is a British science fiction and fantasy author.
Morgan's books are generally set in a post-extropianist dystopian world. Morgan described his "takeaway" of one of his books as:
Born in London, and brought up in the village of Hethersett, near Norwich, Morgan studied history at Queens' College, Cambridge. After graduating he started teaching English in order to travel the world. After 14 years and a post at the University of Strathclyde, his first novel was published and he became a full-time writer. He lived in Glasgow until 2015, when he moved to Saxlingham Nethergate with his wife Virginia and their son Daniel.[2]
In 2002 Morgan's first novel Altered Carbon was published, combining elements of "cyberpunk" and hardboiled detective fiction and featuring the antihero Takeshi Kovacs. The film rights for the book sold for a reported figure of $1,000,000 to film producer Joel Silver, enabling Morgan to become a full-time writer. In 2003 the U.S. edition received the Philip K. Dick Award.
In 2003 Broken Angels was published, the sequel to Altered Carbon, again featuring Takeshi Kovacs and blending science fiction and war fiction in a similar way to his cross-genre d√©but.
Market Forces, Morgan's first non-Kovacs novel, is set in the not-too-distant future. It was originally written as a short story, then as a screenplay (both unpublished). After the success of his first two works, it was released as a novel and optioned as a film.
Morgan's third, and he has stated final,[3] Kovacs novel Woken Furies was released in the UK in March 2005 and in the U.S. in September 2005.
Morgan wrote two six issue miniseries for Marvel Comics under the Marvel Knights imprint. His first story, Black Widow: Homecoming published monthly in 2004 was followed by a second, Black Widow: The Things They Say About Her published monthly in 2005; both are available in collected editions. According to Morgan's official website the series was "an artefact of limited appeal" and is unlikely to be continued, although he has other comic projects in development.
Black Man was released in May 2007 in the UK and in June 2007 in the United States (as Thirteen or Th1rte3n). According to the author, the book is about the constraints of physicality and the fact that people are locked into who they are. These are things he could not deal with in the Kovacs universe, because for Kovacs and people like him mortality is avoidable: they just skip into a new body.[4] The novel won the 2008 Arthur C. Clarke Award.
Morgan wrote a fantasy trilogy with a gay protagonist, A Land Fit for Heroes, the first volume of which has the title The Steel Remains and was published in August 2008 in the UK[5] and on 20 January 2009 in the United States.[6] The second volume, titled The Cold Commands was published in 2011. The third book in the series is called The Dark Defiles and was published on 17 August 2014.[7]
Liber Primus Games is creating a gamebook series based on the A Land Fit For Heroes trilogy. The first game was published for Android, Apple and Amazon Kindle Fire devices on 4 November 2015.
In 2008, he worked with Starbreeze as a writer for Syndicate, the 2012 re-imagining of the 1992 original.[8] Additionally, Morgan worked with Electronic Arts and Crytek as lead writer for their 2011 video game, Crysis 2.
In October 2018, Morgan's science fiction novel, Thin Air was published in the UK by Gollancz.[9]
In an interview before the launch of Thin Air, Morgan described a common feature of his works:
