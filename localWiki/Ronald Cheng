Ronald Cheng Chung-kei (born 9 March 1972) is a Hong Kong singer and actor.
Originally intending to work behind the scenes as a songwriter and a producer, Cheng did odd jobs at his father (Director of EMI Asia)’s company EMI— which included doing backing vocalist for the likes of Alan Tam and Priscilla Chan — during summers as a youth. The lessons were apparently effective, as producers started taking notice of Cheng’s voice and he was signed to a recording contract soon thereafter. Cheng first shot to popularity in Taiwan before returning home and enjoying some success in Hong Kong. However, his singing career went into a lull from 2000 to 2003 due to the infamous “air rage incident” and has only recently rebounded.
Cheng returned to the Cantopop market in 2003, however success for him did not arrive until 2005, where his signature song "無賴" (Rascal) was voted one of the Top 10 songs at various music award shows, notably TVB's Jade Solid Gold, where it was voted the most popular song of 2005.[1]
Cheng won his first Best Supporting Actor award for his performance in Vulgaria (film) at the 32nd Hong Kong Film Award.[2] However, it is noted that this film received a rating of 6.3/10 on iMDB[3] and 57% on Rotten Tomatoes[4] respectively.
Cheng's filmography has been described by critics as "infantile" coupled with "terrible storytelling".[5]
His father, Norman Cheng (鄭東漢), is the chairperson and CEO of EMI, and formerly of the Asia Pacific division of PolyGram and then Universal Music.
Ronald Cheng started his relationship with Charlene Choi, a popular Hong Kong female singer and actress, in 2004, after starring as lovers in the film Hidden Heroes. Cheng and Choi liked to play hide-and-seek.[6] In 2010, while Choi announced ending the relationship with Cheng, the press revealed that they had registered their marriage in Los Angeles, United States in 2006.[7][8] Both Cheng and Choi recognized the marriage, but decided to divorce.[9] Later, he dated with Sammie Yu Sze-man, a former hostess in Cable TV Hong Kong and Sammie Yu gave birth to a daughter. They married in July 2011.[10] They later had a son in 2015.
In 2000, Cheng was on board an Eva Air 747 when he got inebriated and starting pulling a flight attendant by the hair and forcing her onto the ground. Cheng then proceeded to put the flight attendant in a choke hold. Captain John Irving knocked Cheng out cold as a result of Cheng's inappropriate behaviour.[11]
In 2004, Cheng tried to purchase a Mercedes-Benz motor vehicle. Cheng somehow managed to purchase the wrong vehicle and Cheng took revenge by filing a lawsuit against the seller. His attempt to sue and his lawsuit ultimately failed. As a result of bad faith and malicious intent, Cheng was ordered by the District Court to pay the legal costs of the salesman he tried to sue.[12]
