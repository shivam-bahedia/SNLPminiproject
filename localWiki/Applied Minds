Applied Minds, LLC. is an American company founded in 2000 by ex-Disney Imagineers and Bran Ferren, Danny Hillis, and Douglas Carlston that provides technology, design, R&D, and consulting services to multiple firms, including General Motors, Intel, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Herman Miller, Harris Corporation, Sony, and Sun MicroSystems. The company's headquarters are in Burbank, California, and it maintains offices in New York and Washington DC.
It supplies products and services in software, aerospace, entertainment, electronics, biotechnology and architectural design. It has spun out several companies including Metaweb Technologies (the creators of Freebase, which was acquired by Google), TouchTable, and Applied Proteomics.
Applied Minds has been chosen to do major renovations to the Renwick Gallery in Washington, DC.[1] Elizabeth Broun, the Margaret and Terry Stent Director of the Smithsonian American Art Museum said that the "Applied Minds concept is that it encourages visitors to come back again and again to see the many new and ever-changing presentations there."[1]
In 2014 Danny Hillis split off his portion of the company and founded a new company Applied Invention.
