Jeffrey Lynn Goldblum was born to Jewish parents on October 22, 1952, in West Homestead, Pennsylvania. He is of Austrian-Jewish and Russian-Jewish descent.[1][2] His mother, Shirley Jane Goldblum (née Temeles; 30 October 1926 – 9 January 2012),[3] was a radio broadcaster who later ran a kitchen equipment and appliances sales firm; his father, Harold Leonard Goldblum (25 April 1920 – 23 February 1983), was a medical doctor and major in the U.S. Army during World War II.[4][5][6] He has a sister, Pamela, and an elder brother, Lee. His other brother, Rick, whom Goldblum has described as a “kind of hero of mine”, died in 1971 (age 23) whilst travelling in Morocco, having contracted dysentery which led to kidney failure. Goldblum credits his interest in jazz music to Rick’s influence whilst they were growing up. He has stated that his brother’s early death made him “more focused” and gave him a determination to “save myself and survive”.[7][8]
During his childhood, Goldblum belonged to an Orthodox synagogue and had a bar mitzvah ceremony.[9] His parents were interested in show business.[10] His father nearly studied acting before deciding to pursue medical studies, going on to become Chief of Medicine at a Pittsburgh hospital.[7][11] Goldblum moved to New York City at 17 to become an actor. He worked on the stage and studied acting at the renowned Neighborhood Playhouse under the guidance of acting coach Sanford Meisner. He made his Broadway debut in the Tony Award-winning musical Two Gentlemen of Verona. He is also an accomplished jazz pianist and declared that if he did not act, he would have become a professional musician.
Goldblum made his film debut as a home-invading thug in the 1974 Charles Bronson film Death Wish. He briefly appeared as a protester in the TV movie Columbo: A Case of Immunity (1975). He has a brief part as a party guest in Annie Hall (1977); Goldblum is seen saying into the telephone at a Hollywood party, "This is Mr. Davis. I forgot my mantra."[12] Goldblum has had leading roles in films such as The Fly (1986), Jurassic Park (1993), Earth Girls Are Easy, The Tall Guy, Vibes (1988) and Into the Night (1985).
