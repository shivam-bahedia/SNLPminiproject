Tyrone Tyrin Wallace Jr. (born June 10, 1994) is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the California Golden Bears.
Wallace attended Bakersfield High School, where he became his school's all-time scoring leader with 1,767 career points.[1] He was also a two-time Bakersfield Californian Player of the Year, and in his senior season in 2012, he was a Second Team All-CIF selection. He was rated the 13th best point guard in the nation by Rivals.com and given a 4-star rating.[2]
Wallace chose to attend the University of California, Berkeley, over several other schools, including Pac-12 rivals Oregon and Arizona State. Coach Mike Montgomery made him a starter just 10 games into his freshman year, and Wallace responded, averaging 7.2 points and 4.4 rebounds per game the rest of the season.[3] The Bears made the NCAA Tournament that year, upsetting a higher-ranked UNLV team before falling in the second round to Syracuse.
Wallace continued to make strides in his sophomore year, as he started every game but one and led the team in steals (44) and 3-pointers (43).[3] By his junior season, Wallace had become a star, as he averaged 17.1 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 4 assists per game. He was named first-team All-Pac-12, and was a finalist for the Bob Cousy Award, given to the nation's top point guard. One of his many highlights included hitting a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give Cal a 70-69 victory over USC.[2]
On April 23, 2015, Wallace announced that he would forgo the NBA draft and return to UC Berkeley for his senior season.[4]
Wallace was taken by the Utah Jazz with the last pick of the 2016 NBA draft.[5][6] In July 2016, he joined the Jazz for the 2016 NBA Summer League.[7] On October 31, 2016, he was acquired by the Salt Lake City Stars, the Jazz's NBA Development League affiliate.[8] He was waived on November 10 after suffering an injury.[9] On November 14, he was reacquired by the Stars.[10] On July 18, 2017, his right was reported to have renounced, allowing Wallace to sign with any NBA team.[11]
On September 27, 2017, Wallace signed with the Los Angeles Clippers.[12] After being one of the final cuts by the Clippers in preseason, he was signed to their G League affiliate, the Agua Caliente Clippers.
On January 5, 2018, after displaying some positive results in the Agua Caliente Clippers squad, the Los Angeles Clippers would sign Wallace to a two-way contract. Throughout the rest of the year, he would split his playing time between the Los Angeles squad and the Agua Caliente squad. On January 10, 2018, Wallace scored a career-high 22 points off the bench in the Clippers' 125-106 win at the Golden State Warriors.
On September 3, 2018, Wallace signed an offer sheet with the New Orleans Pelicans. Two days later, the Clippers exercised their right of first refusal and matched the offer sheet.[13]
On July 6, 2019, Wallace was waived by the Clippers.[14]
On July 8, 2019, Wallace was claimed off waivers by the Minnesota Timberwolves,[15] however, he was waived on October 21.[16] Two days later, he was claimed off waivers by the Atlanta Hawks.[17] On December 14, 2019, the Atlanta Hawks requested waivers on Wallace.[18]
Wallace is the son of Tyrone Wallace Sr. and Michelle Wallace. He has a younger brother, Da’zion Wallace, and younger sister, Diamond Wallace, as well as an older brother, Ryan Carolina. He majored in Social Welfare.[2]
