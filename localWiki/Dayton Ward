Dayton Ward (born June 7, 1967) is a science fiction author primarily known for his Star Trek novels and short stories, which began with publication in the Strange New Worlds anthology series. He published stories in each of the first three Strange New Worlds volumes, making him the first author to render himself ineligible under the rules of that series. As such, future authors who achieved the same feat were said to have earned a "Wardy".
In addition to his Star Trek books, he has written numerous articles related to Star Trek in Star Trek Communicator and Star Trek Magazine. He has also published a number of short stories in various magazines and collections. His frequent collaborator on these and other works is fellow author Kevin Dilmore.
Ward has been nominated six times for, and has won twice, the Scribe Award from the International Association of Media Tie-In Writers. The winning entries were Star Trek: The Next Generation: Armageddon's Arrow, in 2016,[1] and Star Trek: Discovery: Drastic Measures, in 2019.[2]
Before he became a successful author, Ward enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, where he served for more than eleven years, before being honorably discharged. He lives with his family in Kansas City, Missouri, where he works as a software developer when not writing. His stated hobbies include reading, going to movies, and watching football, basketball, or beach volleyball.
He is a fan of Canadian rock band Rush, and several of his stories have been named after Rush songs.
