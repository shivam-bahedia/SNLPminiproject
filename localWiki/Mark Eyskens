Marc Maria Frans, Viscount Eyskens (born 29 April 1933), known as Mark Eyskens [ˈmɑrk ˈɛi̯skəns] (listen), is a Belgian economist and politician in the Christian People's Party (Belgium), now called Christian Democratic and Flemish, and briefly served as Prime Minister of Belgium in 1981.
He was born in Leuven, the son of Gaston Eyskens, and lived for a time at the International House of New York. When Germany invaded Belgium Eyskens and his mother fled to France but upon the Belgian capitulation the family returned to Leuven.
In 1953 Mark Eyskens attained a bachelor's degree in philosophy. In 1956 Eyskens became a doctor iuris at the University of Leuven. In 1957 he obtained a Master of Arts in Economics at Columbia University. In 1962 he received a doctorate in economic sciences. In 1962 he became a professor at the University of Leuven (1962–1998). From 1971 to 1976 he was chairman of the university. He was a member of the Club of Rome (1972–1978). In 2004 he was chairman of the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts.
In 1962 Eyskens started his political career as a counsellor in the cabinet of the Minister of Finance André Dequae.
In 1976 Eyskens became Secretary of State for Town and Country Planning and Housing (1976–1977, Tindemans I). Eyskens was first elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives in 1977. He was re-elected (elections of 1977, 1981, 1985, 1987, 1991, 1978, 1995, 1999) and served until 2003.
He became Secretary of State for the budget and Flemish affairs (1977–1979, Tindemans II & Vanden Boeynants II), Minister of Development Aid (1979–1980, Martens I, Martens II & Martens III) and Minister of Finance (1980–1981, Martens IV). Mark Eyskens became the 45th Prime Minister of Belgium on 6 April 1981, an office his father had held six times. His government quickly collapsed on 17 December, due to disagreements on the financing of the Walloon steel industry. After the fall of his government he served as Minister for Economical Affairs (1981–1985, Martens V) and Minister of Finance (1985–1988, Martens VI & Martens VII). Although originally not a member of the Martens VIII cabinet, on 19 June 1989 he re-entered the government when he replaced Leo Tindemans as Minister of Foreign Affairs (1989–1992, Martens VIII & Martens IX). This was the last government office he held. He served as a backbencher 1992–2003 and retired at the 2003 general election.
On 18 November 1998 Mark Eyskens was made a Minister of State. In the 2006 provincial elections Eyskens was elected to the provincial council of Vlaams Brabant. He served from 2007 until his resignation in 2009.
Eyskens is a Member of the Advisory Board of the Global Panel Foundation, a member of the Advisory Board of the Itinera Institute think-tank and as Honorary President of the Olivaint Conference of Belgium.[1]
