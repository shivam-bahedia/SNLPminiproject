The game, a 43–42 win over the Bishop Noll Institute, was played at Conseco Fieldhouse in front of 11,035 fans and a statewide television audience.[8]
In a summer game on August 8, 2011, Ferrell played in a nationally televised game at Adidas Nations in California and recorded 14 assists.[10] On November 8, 2011, Ferrell appeared on 'Guard Play with Kenny "The Jet" Smith,' where he got a lesson from the former NBA player and TNT analyst.[11]
In his senior year of high school, on March 24, 2012, Ferrell won a second 2A IHSAA State Championship and tied a championship game record with 12 assists.[12] He also contributed 17 points and nine rebounds, coming up just one rebound short of a triple-double. Ferrell finished his senior year averaging 18.5 points, 3.1 rebounds and 6.6 assists per game, as the team went 26–2 during the season.[9] In the March 28, 2012 McDonald's All-American Game, Ferrell played 22 minutes and had a game-high eight assists with zero turnovers. He was the only player in the game with four or more assists and no turnovers.[13] Ferrell was Indiana Mr. Basketball runner-up behind Gary Harris.[14]
On November 9, 2011, Ferrell signed a letter of intent to play for Indiana University, turning down offers from Butler, Florida, Virginia, and Wake Forest. Upon committing to Indiana he said, "The main goal I actually want to accomplish coming in to college is winning a national championship."[15] Ferrell was one of five players included in an Indiana University recruiting class ranked by Rivals.com as second in the nation for 2012.[16]
In his freshman year during the 2012–13 season, Ferrell was described as running the offense "with the focus of a surgeon" while playing tenacious defense.[17] According to Indiana head coach Tom Crean, "He's wiser than his years. He's at his best in big environments."[17] His team finished the regular season as outright Big Ten champions. Ferrell finished the season averaging 7.6 points, 4.1 assists, and 2.8 rebounds in 28.1 minutes per game.[18] He also shot 40.3% from the field and 79.8% from the free throw line.

He also joined the elite club at IU in which only five Hoosiers have 1,000 career points, 400 career assists, and 300 career rebounds. Ferrell was also the first player to lead the team in points and assists in back-to-back seasons since Isiah Thomas did it in 1981.

Despite coming off the bench, he was solid again with 10 points and seven of Dallas' season-high 32 assists in a 112–80 win.[45] On March 2, 2017, he was named Western Conference Rookie of the Month for games played in February. He led all Western Conference rookies in scoring (12.0 ppg), assists (4.7 apg) and minutes (31.5 mpg) in February.[46][47] At the season's end, he was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team.[48]
