Intec was started in the UK in 1997 to sell interconnect billing systems. From this point the company expanded both organically and through acquisition. Intec became a public company in 2000, following its IPO on the London Stock Exchange. The following year it completed its first acquisition, with the purchase of Computer Generation Inc (CGI)[2] and Dataphone UK Ltd.[3] In 2002 Intec further consolidated the interconnect billing market with acquisitions from ICL[4] and Ericsson.[5] In 2003 Intec entered the IP services mediation and charging market with the acquisition of Digiquant[6] (the assets of which were subsequently sold to Volubill[7]). The Digiquant acquisition was followed in 2004 with the acquisition of the Singl.eView product line from ADC.[8] In 2006 Intec acquired EUR systems, a USA based provider of bureau services, which has been integrated with Intec’s other managed services and outsourcing facilities.[9]
