Collin Darnell Sexton (born January 4, 1999) is an American professional basketball player for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Alabama Crimson Tide. In January 2017 Sexton was selected as a McDonald's All-American.[1] He was selected with the 8th pick in the 2018 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers.
Collin is the son of Darnell and Gia Sexton. He has one older brother, Jordan, and one older sister, Giauna. He started playing basketball when he was three years old. Collin transferred to Pebblebrook HS, prior to his junior year and helped the Falcons to a 2016 Georgia Region 3-6A title and the 2016 Georgia Class 6A state championship game; while averaging 23 points, 7.4 rebounds and 2.9 assists.[2]
Sexton was considered one of the best players in the 2017 recruiting class by Scout.com, Rivals.com and ESPN.[3][4] On November 10, 2016, Sexton committed to the Alabama Crimson Tide, on the same day he signed his letter of intent (LOI).[5]
Collin Sexton attended the University of Alabama, playing for coach Avery Johnson. On November 25, 2017, he scored 40 points while playing shorthanded (3-on-5) during most of the second half in a loss to the University of Minnesota.[6][7] In the opening game of the SEC Tournament, Collin Sexton scored 27 points against Texas A&M including the game winning buzzer-beater, then 31 points in a quarterfinal win over #1 seed Auburn, and 21 points against Kentucky in a loss during the semifinals. Collin Sexton was named to the All-tournament team after averaging 26.3 ppg, 3 apg, and 5 rpg in 3 games.
Following Alabama's loss in the 2018 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, Sexton announced his intention to forgo his final three seasons of collegiate eligibility and declare for the 2018 NBA draft, where he was expected to be a first round selection.[8]
Before Alabama's exhibition game on November 6, 2017, the school announced that Sexton would not play due to eligibility concerns. These concerns stem from Alabama director of basketball operations Kobie Baker's resignation following an internal investigation after the announcement of an FBI investigation into college basketball corruption.[9] Sexton would, however, make his debut with Alabama on November 14 in a win against Lipscomb University. Later on in February 2018, Sexton's name would pop up as one of the names implicated with the NCAA scandal of receiving payments or dinners. His name was once again cleared.
On June 21, 2018, Sexton was selected with the eighth overall pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2018 NBA draft. He was the highest-selected player from Alabama since Antonio McDyess in 1995. On July 6, 2018, Sexton made his NBA Summer League debut. He recorded 15 points to go along with 7 rebounds.[10] On October 17, 2018, Sexton made his NBA debut, coming off the bench for the Cleveland Cavaliers with nine points and three rebounds in a 104–116 loss to the Toronto Raptors.[11] On November 24, 2018, Sexton scored a then career high 29 points against the Houston Rockets in a 117-108 victory. On December 9, 2018, he scored a season-high 29 points against the Washington Wizards in a 116-101 victory[12]. On March 8, 2019, Sexton passed Kyrie Irving for 3 pointers made as a Cavs rookie with 76 against the Miami Heat. He also eclipsed 1,000 career points. On March 11, 2019, Sexton had 28 points against the Toronto Raptors in a 126-101 victory, to go along with 5 assists and 4 rebounds. In the week of March 8, 2019, Sexton had the best week of his rookie campaign, averaging 26.0 points, 3.8 assists, and 2.5 rebounds. During a stretch from March 8 to March 22, he became the first rookie to score 23+ points in seven consecutive games since Tim Duncan in 1998, as well the only rookie in franchise history to successively score at least 23 points. Additionally, he is the only rookie in NBA history to have played at least 2,000 minutes while scoring over 16 points per game on over 40% 3-point accuracy and fewer than 3 turnovers.
On November 10, 2019, Sexton set a new career high of 31 points en route to a 108-87 rout of the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden.
Sexton won a gold medal with the 2016 USA Men’s U17 World Championship Team, at the 2016 FIBA Under-17 World Championship in Zaragoza, Spain. He was named the MVP of the tournament.
Sexton was born in Marietta, Georgia, and grew up in Mableton with his mother and father, Gia and Darnell Sexton, and his brother, Jordan Sexton.[13]
