Jarrett Allen (born April 21, 1998) is an American professional basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets for the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Texas Longhorns.
Allen attended Round Rock High School in Round Rock, Texas for his freshman year of high school.[1] He then transferred to St. Stephen's Episcopal School in Austin, Texas for his final three years and went on to win two SPC championships.[2] He played in the 2016 McDonald's All-American Boys Game.[3][4] He committed to the University of Texas at Austin to play college basketball.[5][6]
As a freshman at Texas, Allen averaged 13.4 points and 8.4 rebounds per game. However, Texas finished a disappointing 11–22. His best game was a 22-point, 19-rebound performance in a 12-point loss to Kansas. After the season, he entered the 2017 NBA draft but did not initially hire an agent before deciding to forgo his remaining three years of collegiate eligibility.[7][8]
Allen was selected with the 22nd overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft by the Brooklyn Nets,[9] and signed his rookie scale deal with the Nets on July 20.[10] He was 19 years 182 days when he made his NBA debut on October 20, becoming the second-youngest player ever to set foot on court for the Nets, just behind Derrick Favors.[11][12] He finished the game with nine points on 3-for-3 shooting, two rebounds, and one block.[11] On January 25, 2018, Allen joined the starting lineup for the first time and recorded a career-high 16 points and 12 rebounds in a 116–108 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.[13][14] On February 2, in a game against the Los Angeles Lakers, Allen scored a career-high 20 points, as well as five rebounds and one block.[15][16] On February 7, he grabbed a career-high 14 rebounds and scored 13 points in a 115–106 loss to the Detroit Pistons.[17] On March 21, 2018, Allen recorded four blocks, which matched his career-high, as well as six rebounds, and nine points in a 111–105 loss to the Charlotte Hornets.[18] On April 5, he got a career-high five blocks in a 119–111 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks.[19]
On November 17, 2018, Allen recorded a career-high 24 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in a 127–119 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.[20][21] On November 20, he grabbed a season-high 14 rebounds and scored 13 points as the Nets defeated the Miami Heat.[22][23] On January 16, 2019, Allen recorded 20 points and a career-high 24 rebounds in the Nets' 145–142 overtime victory over the Houston Rockets.[24]
Allen's family also plays basketball; his father Leonard was drafted by the Dallas Mavericks in the 1985 NBA draft and played at San Diego State and in Spain.[25] His older brother Leonard Jr. plays collegiate basketball.[26]
