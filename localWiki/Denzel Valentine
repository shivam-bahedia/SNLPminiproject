Denzel Robert Valentine (born November 16, 1993) is an American professional basketball player for the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Michigan State Spartans. As a senior, Valentine became the first player in Michigan State history to be recognized as the National Player of the Year by The Associated Press. He also earned other player of the year awards from the NABC, USA Today, Sports Illustrated, NBC Sports, and Basketball Times in addition to being named a unanimous First-Team All-American.
Valentine attended J. W. Sexton High School, where he was coached by his father, Carlton Valentine (former Michigan State player),[1] and played alongside future Michigan State teammate Bryn Forbes and Iowa basketball player Anthony Clemmons.
As a sophomore, Valentine averaged 10.9 points, 5.8 assists and 6.3 rebounds, leading Sexton to a state title game. He was awarded 2010 Class B honorable mention all-state.[2]
Valentine averaged 14 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists per game as a senior, leading Sexton to a 27–1 record. He was selected as the Lansing State Journal Player of the Year and Associated Press Class B Player of the Year as a senior.[2] As a recruit, Valentine was nationally ranked in the top 100 by Rivals.com (#81, #15 shooting guard), ESPNU100 (#98, #26 small forward), and Scout.com (#27 small forward).[2]
Following his successful freshman year, Valentine was the recipient of MSU's Unsung Player Award (voted on by players).[2] As a sophomore, he earned honorable-mention All-Big Ten (Coaches and Media).[2]
With Adreian Payne and Gary Harris leaving MSU for the NBA Draft, Keith Appling leaving due to graduation (eventually to the NBA), the dismissal of Kenny Kaminski, and the transfer of Russell Byrd, Valentine saw an increase in leadership and an expanded role on the team as a junior. Before the season started, he was awarded one of the three captain spots. Perhaps one of Valentine's most memorable moments came on Valentine's Day 2015, he hit the game winning shot in a matchup versus Ohio State and finished with 17 points.[3] His junior season saw him earn Orlando Classic All-Tournament Team (averaging 19.3 points and 5.0 rebounds in three games), Third Team All-Big Ten, USBWA All-District V, and NCAA East Regional All-Tournament Team honors.[2]
On November 17, 2015, the senior Valentine became the 4th player in Michigan State history to record a triple-double. He had 29 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists in Michigan State's 79-73 victory over the fourth-ranked Kansas Jayhawks.[4] It was the first triple-double of the 2015–16 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.[5] On December 21, it was announced that Valentine would be sidelined for 2–3 weeks after he underwent an arthroscopic knee surgery. He returned on January 10, 2016.[6][7]
He was named to the 35-man midseason watchlist for the Naismith Trophy on February 11.[8] On February 29, he was named a semifinalist of the Oscar Robertson Trophy.[9] Valentine was also a finalist for the John R. Wooden Award, the Adolph Rupp Trophy, Associated Press College Basketball Player of the Year, and the NABC Player of the Year.
Valentine finished the 2015–16 regular season averaging 19.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7.5 assists as MSU finished in second place in the Big Ten. On March 8, USA Today named Valentine National Player of the Year over Oklahoma's Buddy Hield.[10] The Big Ten also announced that Valentine was the Big Ten's Player of the Year.[11] On March 9, Valentine was named to the Sporting News All-American Team.[12]
Valentine's senior year at Michigan State saw him ranked among the NCAA leaders when it came to three-point shooting.[13] He accumulated many awards and won Michigan State's first College Basketball Player of the Year Award since Draymond Green won the NABC Player of the Year in 2012. Valentine shined during the Big Ten Tournament in Indianapolis, earning tournament Most Outstanding Player while winning Michigan State's fifth championship.[14] Valentine, along with Bryn Forbes, were selected to the NCAA College Basketball Three-Point Contest following his senior year.[15] Valentine defeated his teammate in the first round of the competition when he rattled off 22 points compared to Forbes' 10. Valentine was eliminated from the competition in the semifinals when he hit 17 points, needing 23 to advance. Valentine's senior year also proved very effective in raising his draft stock. Valentine went from being potentially undrafted to being seen as a potential lottery pick in the 2016 NBA draft.[16]
