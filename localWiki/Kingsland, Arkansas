The building's old pine, along with the varnish on the floors, oil on the wood inside and a gas heating system all contributed to the blaze.[7] Later, the fire was found to be arson and two suspects, one of them being a firefighter, were subsequently arrested.[8] Damages were estimated to be over $2.1 million.
