In September 2010, Finney-Smith committed to Virginia Tech,[2] and later signed a National Letter of Intent with the Hokies in December.[3]
As a senior at Norcom in 2010–11, Finney-Smith averaged 18 points, 10.7 rebounds and 3.8 blocks per game. He led the team to back-to-back Group AAA championships, along with Eastern Region and District titles. He recorded 19 points, 17 rebounds and three blocks in the state championship game as a senior. He finished his high school career as a two-time VHSL Class AAA Player of the Year and first-team all-state, all-region, All-Tidewater and all-district. He also earned All-Tidewater player of the year as a junior and co-player of the year as a senior.[1]

In June 2012, Finney-Smith transferred to Florida and was forced to sit out the 2012–13 season due to NCAA transfer regulations.[4]
As a sophomore in 2013–14, Finney-Smith was named SEC Sixth Man of the Year, becoming just the second Gator to win the award after Chris Richard in 2007. He was Florida's leading rebounder, both in total rebounds (247) and per-game average (6.7). He also recorded the first 20/15 performance by a Gator in a road game during Billy Donovan's tenure, totaling a personal-best 22 points in an overtime win over Arkansas.

As a senior in 2015–16, Finney-Smith was named second-team All-SEC by the coaches and third-team All-SEC by the Associated Press. He was Florida's leading scorer (14.7) for the second straight season and top rebounder (8.3) for the third consecutive season. He became the first Florida player to join the 1,000-point club after transferring to the school mid-tenure. His 1,220 career points at Florida rank 36th in school history.[1]
After going undrafted in the 2016 NBA draft, Finney-Smith signed with the Dallas Mavericks on July 8, and joined the team for the 2016 NBA Summer League.[5][6] Finney-Smith secured an opening-night roster spot after impressing the Mavericks during training camp and preseason.
